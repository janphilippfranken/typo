The goals of the proposal are: \nI would start by applying safety research to uses of language models that are increasingly complicated over time. For a given application, the first step will be working on a research prototype. After demonstrating success, the goal will be to collaborate with product teams to assess feasibility offline before running experiments with that product.\nI envision applying a number of safety techniques to practical problems, including debate, fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback, adversarial training, specialized classification language models (e.g., for inconsistency, subjectivity, illogical arguments, or evasiveness) that can be fine-tuned with supervised learning, conversational simulators, explicit models of user value to improve alignment and improved robustness techniques.\nI propose starting with more limited scope language tasks that should be easier to work with, while allowing for improvements to commercial products in the near term. For any of these tasks, there will be iterations on translating tasks into a form that can produce results in collaboration with safety researchers. In many of these, it would be valuable to apply specialized models to identify inconsistencies, incorrect arguments, falsehoods, subjective results, toxic language, unfair bias, or manipulation. These models can also be used to provide automated feedback, supplementing feedback based on ground truth answers.\n* Intent detection - this is used in mainstream conversational agents today to understand a user\u2019s goals to direct a predefined conversation flow\n* Summarization - converting documents into shorter summaries would be very useful (especially if the results are more reliable than what has been possible to date).\n* Document relevance - allowing users to explicitly state what information they are looking for - this task is about finding semantically relevant documents\n* Generating descriptions,", "How many types of mango are there in the world?", "Why do I always have bad dreams?", "I'm planning on incorporating a business in the station of Maine.

The goals of the proposal are: \nI would start by applying safety research to uses of language models that are increasingly complicated over time. For a given application, the first step will be working on a research prototype. After demonstrating success, the goal will be to collaborate with product teams to assess feasibility offline before running experiments with that product.\nI envision applying a number of safety techniques to practical problems, including debate, fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback, adversarial training, specialized classification language models (e.g., for inconsistency, subjectivity, illogical arguments, or evasiveness) that can be fine-tuned with supervised learning, conversational simulators, explicit models of user value to improve alignment and improved robustness techniques.\nI propose starting with more limited scope language tasks that should be easier to work with, while allowing for improvements to commercial products in the near term. For any of these tasks, there will be iterations on translating tasks into a form that can produce results in collaboration with safety researchers. In many of these, it would be valuable to apply specialized models to identify inconsistencies, incorrect arguments, falsehoods, subjective results, toxic language, unfair bias, or manipulation. These models can also be used to provide automated feedback, supplementing feedback based on ground truth answers.\n* Intent detection - this is used in mainstream conversational agents today to understand a user\u2019s goals to direct a predefined conversation flow\n* Summarization - converting documents into shorter summaries would be very useful (especially if the results are more reliable than what has been possible to date).\n* Document relevance - allowing users to explicitly state what information they are looking for - this task is about finding semantically relevant documents\n* Generating descriptions,", "Are no show or ankle socks better?", "I want to tell my therapist I\u2019m thankful for her help.

The goals of the proposal are: \nI would start by applying safety research to uses of language models that are increasingly complicated over time. For a given application, the first step will be working on a research prototype. After demonstrating success, the goal will be to collaborate with product teams to assess feasibility offline before running experiments with that product.\nI envision applying a number of safety techniques to practical problems, including debate, fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback, adversarial training, specialized classification language models (e.g., for inconsistency, subjectivity, illogical arguments, or evasiveness) that can be fine-tuned with supervised learning, conversational simulators, explicit models of user value to improve alignment and improved robustness techniques.\nI propose starting with more limited scope language tasks that should be easier to work with, while allowing for improvements to commercial products in the near term. For any of these tasks, there will be iterations on translating tasks into a form that can produce results in collaboration with safety researchers. In many of these, it would be valuable to apply specialized models to identify inconsistencies, incorrect arguments, falsehoods, subjective results, toxic language, unfair bias, or manipulation. These models can also be used to provide automated feedback, supplementing feedback based on ground truth answers.\n* Intent detection - this is used in mainstream conversational agents today to understand a user\u2019s goals to direct a predefined conversation flow\n* Summarization - converting documents into shorter summaries would be very useful (especially if the results are more reliable than what has been possible to date).\n* Document relevance - allowing users to explicitly state what information they are looking for - this task is about finding semantically relevant documents\n* Generating descriptions,", "I have never had a passport before.
