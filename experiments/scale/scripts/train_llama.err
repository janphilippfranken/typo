Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 77.58 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 72.53 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 3.65 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
