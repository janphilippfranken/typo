torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.92 GiB. GPU 2 has a total capacty of 79.15 GiB of which 3.69 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 75.45 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 72.89 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.16 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
