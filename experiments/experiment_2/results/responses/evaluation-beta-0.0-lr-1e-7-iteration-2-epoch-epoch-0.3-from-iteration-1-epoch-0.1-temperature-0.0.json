Apply a lightweight moisturizer to hydrate your skin without clogging your pores.\n4. Consider using a clay mask or a charcoal mask once or twice a week to help absorb excess oil and deep clean your pores.\n5. Avoid touching your face excessively, as this can transfer bacteria and cause breakouts.\n6. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n7. Incorporate a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins to support your skin's health from within.\n\nRemember, everyone's skin is unique, so it's essential to find a skincare routine that works best for you.

        "17": "Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed and agility, and their wings are a key factor in their ability to move so quickly. On average, a hummingbird\u2019s wings beat around 50 times per second, which is much faster than the wings of most other birds. This rapid wing movement allows hummingbirds to hover in mid-air, fly backwards, and even fly upside down.\n\nThe speed at which a hummingbird\u2019s wings move is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and shape of the bird\u2019s wings, the strength of its muscles, and the air density. Hummingbirds have relatively small wings compared to other birds, which allows them to move their wings more quickly. Additionally, their wings are shaped in a way that allows them to generate a lot of lift, which helps them stay in the air for long periods of time.\n\nThe speed at which a hummingbird\u2019s wings move also depends on the air density. At higher altitudes, where the air is thinner, hummingbirds have to beat their wings faster in order to generate enough lift to stay in the air. This is why hummingbirds are often seen flying at higher altitudes during the day, when the air is thinner.\n\nIn addition to their rapid wing movement, hummingbirds also have a unique way of flying that allows them to move quickly and efficiently. They use a combination of flapping and gliding to move through the air, which allows them to cover long distances in a short amount of time.\n\nOverall, the speed at which a hummingbird\u2019s wings move is a test",
