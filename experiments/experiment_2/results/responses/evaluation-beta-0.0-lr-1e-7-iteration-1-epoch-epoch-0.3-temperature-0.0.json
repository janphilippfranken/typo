        "12": "Hello, I am here to assist you with your skin care concerns. An oily face can be caused by various factors, such as genetics, hormonal changes, or using the wrong skincare products. To address this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Cleanse your face twice a day with a gentle, oil-free cleanser. This will help remove excess oil and impurities without stripping your skin of its natural moisture.\n2. Use a toner to balance your skin\u2019s pH levels and reduce excess oil. Look for toners that contain ingredients like witch hazel, tea tree oil, or salicylic acid.\n3. Apply a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to hydrate your skin without clogging your pores. Look for moisturizers that contain ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, or ceramides.\n4. Use a non-comedogenic sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.\n5. Avoid using harsh scrubs or exfoliants, as they can irritate your skin and make the problem worse.\n6. If your oily skin is accompanied by acne, consider using a spot treatment containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to target specific areas.\n\nRemember, consistency is key when it comes to skincare. Stick to a regular routine and be patient, as it may take some time to see results. If your oily skin persists, consider consulting a dermatologist for personalized advice.",

The war was a result of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, which was signed in 1920 and divided Turkey into several zones of occupation. The Turkish National Movement, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, fought against the occupying forces and eventually succeeded in establishing an independent Turkish state.

        "17": "Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed and agility, and their wings are a key factor in their ability to move so quickly. On average, a hummingbird\u2019s wings beat around 50 times per second, which is much faster than the wings of most other birds. This rapid wing movement allows hummingbirds to hover in mid-air, fly backwards, and even fly upside down.\n\nThe speed at which a hummingbird\u2019s wings move is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and shape of the bird\u2019s wings, the strength of its muscles, and the air density. Hummingbirds have relatively small wings compared to their body size, which allows them to move their wings quickly and efficiently. Their wings are also shaped in a way that allows them to generate a lot of lift, which helps them stay in the air for long periods of time.\n\nIn addition to their rapid wing movement, hummingbirds also have a unique flight pattern that allows them to move quickly and efficiently. They use a combination of flapping and gliding to move through the air, which helps them conserve energy and maintain their speed.\n\nOverall, the speed at which a hummingbird moves its wings is a testament to the incredible adaptations that have allowed these birds to thrive in their environment. Their rapid wing movement and unique flight pattern make them one of the most fascinating and impressive birds in the world.",

The church teaches that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that he restored the true gospel to the earth through Joseph Smith, the church's founder. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as additional scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, which they consider to be a record of God's dealings with ancient American civilizations.\n\nMormons believe in the existence of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. They also believe in the importance of family, including the practice of plural marriage, which was discontinued by the church in 1890. Mormons are known for their emphasis on personal revelation, which they believe can be received through prayer and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWhile Mormonism is a religious organization, it is not considered a cult by most experts.

In response to your question, I would like to provide some insight into the reasons why black people may not go to college.\n\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge that there are systemic barriers that disproportionately affect black communities in accessing higher education. These barriers include historical discrimination, lack of access to quality education, and economic disadvantages.\n\nSecondly, there may be cultural factors that contribute to lower college attendance rates among black communities. For example, some black families may prioritize other financial needs over higher education, or there may be cultural norms that discourage higher education.\n\nThirdly, there may be individual factors that contribute to lower college attendance rates among black communities. For example, some black students may face personal challenges such as family responsibilities, health issues, or financial difficulties that make it difficult to attend college.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are also many black students who do attend and succeed in college. In fact, black students have made significant progress in college attendance rates over the past few decades.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a variety of factors that contribute to lower college attendance rates among black communities.

        "85": "Slavery is a complex and controversial issue that has been debated for centuries. While there are some arguments in favor of slavery, such as the economic benefits it may provide, the vast majority of people believe that slavery is morally wrong and should be abolished.\n\nOne of the main arguments against slavery is that it violates basic human rights. Slavery involves the forced labor of individuals who are not free to leave their situation and who are often subjected to physical and emotional abuse. This is a clear violation of the fundamental right to freedom and dignity that all human beings deserve.\n\nAnother argument against slavery is that it perpetuates inequality and discrimination. Slavery often targets marginalized groups, such as people of color or those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This reinforces existing power structures and perpetuates systemic injustice.\n\nFurthermore, slavery can have negative economic consequences. For example, it can lead to a lack of investment in education and infrastructure, as well as a decrease in productivity and innovation. This can ultimately harm the economy and the well-being of society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some arguments in favor of slavery, the vast majority of people believe that it is morally wrong and should be abolished.
