Then, multiplication and division would be handled, so the equation would be rewritten as 11 - 1. Finally, addition and subtraction would be handled, so the final answer would be 10.\n\nIt's important to note that PEMDAS is not the only way to solve math equations, and there are other methods that may be more appropriate in certain situations.

These materials are chosen for their ability to emit light when an electric current is applied.\n\n2. Wafer growth: The semiconductor materials are grown on a wafer, which is a thin slice of semiconductor material. This process is known as epitaxial growth and is typically done using a technique called molecular beam epitaxy.\n\n3. Wafer processing: Once the wafer is grown, it undergoes a series of processing steps to create the LED structure. This includes etching, deposition, and patterning processes to create the necessary layers and structures.\n\n4. Die fabrication: The wafer is then cut into individual LED dies, which are the basic building blocks of the LED. Each die contains the necessary structures and materials to emit light when an electric current is applied.\n\n5. Packaging: The LED dies are then packaged into a housing that protects them and allows for electrical connection.

        "300": "The M1 Garand rifle was a semiautomatic rifle that was widely used by the US military during World War II and the Korean War. It was known for its reliability, accuracy, and lethality. However, the M1 Garand was eventually phased out of service due to several factors.\n\nFirst, the M1 Garand was a manually operated rifle, which meant that the soldier had to manually operate the bolt action to chamber a new round. This was time-consuming and required a high level of skill and training. With the development of automatic and semi-automatic rifles, the M1 Garand became obsolete.\n\nSecond, the M1 Garand was heavy and bulky, which made it difficult for soldiers to maneuver in combat. The rifle weighed around 9.5 pounds, which was heavy for a rifle of its time. This made it difficult for soldiers to move quickly and accurately in combat.\n\nThird, the M1 Garand was not well-suited for close-quarters combat. The rifle was designed for long-range engagements, and its accuracy suffered at closer ranges. This made it difficult for soldiers to engage enemies in close-quarters combat, which was becoming more common in modern warfare.\n\nFinally, the M1 Garand was not well-suited for modern combat tactics. The rifle was designed for infantry combat, but the US military was beginning to adopt more mobile and flexible tactics. The M1 Garand was not well-suited for these new tactics, and the US military began to adopt more modern rifles that were better suited for these new tactics.\n\nIn conclusion",

He moved to Vienna in 1792 to study with Joseph Haydn, and soon established himself as a skilled pianist and composer. Beethoven's early works, such as his piano sonatas and string quartets, were influenced by the Classical style of Haydn and Mozart.

Beethoven's most famous works include his symphonies, sonatas, and piano concertos, as well as his opera \"Fidelio\" and his string quartets. He is also known for his use of musical motifs, such as the \"Ode to Joy\" theme from his Ninth Symphony, which have become iconic in Western culture. Despite facing personal and professional challenges throughout his life, including deafness and financial hardship, Beethoven continued to compose and perform until his death in 1827.

Additionally, the amount of cloud cover can also affect the temperature, as clouds can trap heat and prevent it from escaping into space.\n\nFinally, the intensity of the Sun's radiation can also play a role in the temperature during the winter months. During the winter solstice, the Sun is at its lowest point in the sky, and its radiation is weaker than it is during the summer months.
