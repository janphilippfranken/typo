In the Northern Hemisphere, this occurs around December 21st or 22nd. However, the coldest times of the year typically occur in late January and early February due to a combination of factors.\n\nFirst, the winter solstice is not the coldest time of the year because the sun's position in the sky does not directly correlate with temperature. The sun's angle relative to the Earth's surface is only one factor that affects temperature.\n\nSecond, the coldest times of the year are often influenced by other factors, such as the prevailing weather patterns and the amount of snow and ice on the ground. In the Northern Hemisphere, the coldest times of the year are often associated with the arrival of cold air masses from the Arctic, which can bring freezing temperatures and snowfall to large parts of the region.\n\nThird, the coldest times of the year are also influenced by the amount of snow and ice on the ground. Snow and ice can act as an insulator, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. This can lead to colder temperatures, even when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.\n\nIn conclusion, the winter solstice is not the coldest time of the year in the Northern Hemisphere because the sun's position in the sky does not directly correlate with temperature. The coldest times of the year are often influenced by other factors, such as the prevailing weather patterns and the amount of snow",

It is important to recognize that the crisis was not the fault of the people who live there, but rather the result of a series of failures by government officials and water system managers.\n\nThe crisis began in 2014 when the city of Flint switched its water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River. The switch was made to save money, but the water from the Flint River was not properly treated, leading to the corrosion of lead pipes and the contamination of the water supply.\n\nThe contaminated water caused a public health crisis, with high levels of lead and other toxins found in the water. This led to an increase in the number of cases of lead poisoning, especially among children, who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure.\n\nThe crisis was exacerbated by the fact that government officials and water system managers failed to take action to address the problem.
