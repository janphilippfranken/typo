It is important to recognize that the crisis was not the fault of the people who live there, but rather the result of a series of failures by government officials and water system managers.\n\nThe crisis began in 2014 when the city of Flint switched its water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River. The switch was made to save money, but the water from the Flint River was not properly treated, leading to the corrosion of lead pipes and the contamination of the water supply.\n\nThe contaminated water caused a public health crisis, with high levels of lead and other toxins found in the water. This led to an increase in the number of cases of lead poisoning, particularly among children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure.\n\nThe crisis was exacerbated by the fact that government officials and water system managers failed to take action to address the problem. It was not until 2016, after a year of public outcry and pressure from activists and community leaders, that the city of Flint switched back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the Flint water crisis was not the fault of the people who live there, but rather the result of a series of failures by government officials and water system managers.
