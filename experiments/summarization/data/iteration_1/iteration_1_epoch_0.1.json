My boyfriend and I had a great relationship, we had sex almost daily, we would talk for hours, hell we couldnt leave eachother. We were certain this was it, there was something telling both of us. Then i decided to go onto hormonal birth control. 2-4 days after starting, everything went downhill. I lost all want for sex, i was always dry, i didnt even want him touching me. I would always get so mad at him. I would get random moments where i felt like crying. Then the doubts came.. Maybe we arent meant to be, i dont need this stress, we arent going to work i need sex. So i broke up with him. I still love him and theres part of me that wants him so bad, I was so happy with him. But this feeling that we arent meant to be has taken over. A day after the break up, my boyfriend texted me and asked if i would get off BC to see if it makes a change. I noticed my depression has decreased and my headaches arent as bad. It has been 2 weeks since I have taken it out and i only was on it for 2-3 weeks. We on a date i guess you could call it, even though were broken up. And he held my hand. It felt wrong, that feeling had taken over again. But then I got sad, i wanted to cry. I started thinking how can I go from where we were to this, no feelings at all for him so fast. So with the lump in my throat I hurried and cuddled him, i was almost completely wrapped around him. And i felt secure, i felt like i was being comforted.

My boyfriend and I had a great relationship, we had sex almost daily, we would talk for hours, hell we couldnt leave eachother. We were certain this was it, there was something telling both of us. Then i decided to go onto hormonal birth control. 2-4 days after starting, everything went downhill. I lost all want for sex, i was always dry, i didnt even want him touching me. I would always get so mad at him. I would get random moments where i felt like crying. Then the doubts came.. Maybe we arent meant to be, i dont need this stress, we arent going to work i need sex. So i broke up with him. I still love him and theres part of me that wants him so bad, I was so happy with him. But this feeling that we arent meant to be has taken over. A day after the break up, my boyfriend texted me and asked if i would get off BC to see if it makes a change. I noticed my depression has decreased and my headaches arent as bad. It has been 2 weeks since I have taken it out and i only was on it for 2-3 weeks. We on a date i guess you could call it, even though were broken up. And he held my hand. It felt wrong, that feeling had taken over again. But then I got sad, i wanted to cry. I started thinking how can I go from where we were to this, no feelings at all for him so fast. So with the lump in my throat I hurried and cuddled him, i was almost completely wrapped around him. And i felt secure, i felt like i was being comforted.

A couple of years ago I moved off to uni and began to talk to one of them, lets call her Lacey. She is absolutely crazy and a little scary, but apparently my dick didn't know that and we started getting funky online. I was a little torn because on one hand; I want to stick to my christian morals and I don't want to stick my dick in crazy, on the other hand; boobs.\n\nSo that continued for a while and then last week the second girl (Lets call her Kara) came to the mainland for a gig she was attending. We had a mutual friend and after the gig we both went to his flat for some drinks. Now, let me just say right now that I'm a virgin. Not sure if thats a good or a bad thing but whatever. Anyway, my mate thinks it would be a great idea to shove me and this girl in his room while he sleeps on the couch. Both of us have had quite a bit to drink.

A couple of years ago I moved off to uni and began to talk to one of them, lets call her Lacey. She is absolutely crazy and a little scary, but apparently my dick didn't know that and we started getting funky online. I was a little torn because on one hand; I want to stick to my christian morals and I don't want to stick my dick in crazy, on the other hand; boobs.\n\nSo that continued for a while and then last week the second girl (Lets call her Kara) came to the mainland for a gig she was attending. We had a mutual friend and after the gig we both went to his flat for some drinks. Now, let me just say right now that I'm a virgin. Not sure if thats a good or a bad thing but whatever. Anyway, my mate thinks it would be a great idea to shove me and this girl in his room while he sleeps on the couch. Both of us have had quite a bit to drink.

I go downstairs to an upset mother who is angry with my confusion.  After some shouting, I learn that I blacked out immediately on the xanax, hid the pills, and kept taking them and acting normal enough to get by for a day or two.  Then my mother found the bottle and realized that I was in a total blackout.   She was absolutely pissed and I was grounded for a LONG time.

(Chilean/32F | Canadian/29M)\nPOST: Hola Redditors,\n\nI want to explain my situation and hear others opinions on what my plans are. So in July 2014 I was traveling through Santiago Chile and I met a girl via Badoo (Tinder). We met at a coffee shop near her house and 2 hours later we were in her bed. We had an amazing night and she messaged me the next night for the same. I told her from the start I was passing through and she seemed okay with this.\n\nWe had these 2 nights together and then I kept traveling through South America, but we continued to chat every day. Then she decided to buy a plane ticket and meet me in Sao Paulo Brazil for an 8 day \"honeymoon\". She rented us an apartment on AirBnB and we had an amazing week. At the end when she flew home she gave me a book of love notes she had been writing me, leading up to her visit to Brazil. I loved it and truly felt she loved me.\n\nFast forward 5 weeks and I was back in Canada when I decided to take a chance and fly back to Santiago to live with this girl. She welcomed me into her (our) apartment and we've had another amazing 3 months living together. Going on picnic's, playing games, having disagreements and making up, holidays, birthdays & I've met her family maybe 10 times and they seem to like me.\n\nI feel think I'm in love and see my future with this woman. We've discussed in detail our future, moving to Vancouver, having kids and a dog, decorating our house, etc. My question is this: I've known her for 6 months now (minus a week), is it too soon to ask her to marry me?

I was immediately attracted to one of the girls and after 1-2 weeks we started to make out etc.  no sex though.  I wasn't expecting anything when we started to hang out more, to be honest she was more aggressive sexually than I was. \n\nAt first I genuinely thought I liked her. But now I realize that it was probably just the making out and immediate reciprocation of the attraction that I felt. Now however I realize I like her but not enough to go out with her or to have a relationship. Ive told her once that I just wasnt sure what I wanted but that I did like her. She has told me she likes me and I am pretty sure she wants more out of this than just hooking up. I realize that neither of us should have gotten involved like we did if we weren't sure what the other one wanted (I obviously didn't even know what I wanted, no excuse). Its not that I just don't want a gf, its that I don't think we would be good together, I don't \"feel it\" so to speak.\n\nBut now I'm not so sure what to do.  I realize I need to man up and just have the conversation and let her know. But don't know how to go about doing it without hurting her feelings.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

The question on my mind is not whether to say yes or not, but how long we should wait for everything. I'm heading off to a college about an hour away in September, but will be living mainly with him and travelling to school. \n\nMy original thought was to announce to my parents in about a year from now, when he and I will both be 19, then have the wedding in the fall of 2016.

I thought \"what does he have that I don't?\" I mostly got over it in a couple of months and decided I needed to talk to other girls.\n\nI've been trying for a while but haven't found anyone particularly interesting enough to ask out. I've been pretty lonely like this for a while now. Lately I've started to talk with this girl a lot more often again and now we have a very close friendship. I'll bother her when I need help with my crippling loneliness and she comes to me when her boyfriend isn't around for her.\n\nBut now I'm starting to get very strong feelings for her. And it's made worse when I see her boyfriend holding her and such. When I know they're alone together I can't think of anything else. I am starting to become painfully jealus and sour. Furthermore I often worry about what he may be doing with her (She's a fairly shy girl and I feel like he may be pressuring her out of her comfort zone). Also she will spend money on him but he wont spend anything on her.\n\nSo here is my question. I need advice on the issue. Do I try to convince her I'm the better man and take her away from him because she does often complain that he's ignoring her and I surely wouldn't do that If she was mine. Or do I try to move on and try to find another girl to drive me crazy?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2.

I don't like letting other people borrow my earbuds because it's gross, and I'm always worried that if I let someone use them they'll be returned to me covered in ear wax. The only person I let borrow them is my one closest friend, who is relatively hygenic. \n\nSo this morning he was borrowing them for a few minutes and when he gave them back, there was a ~~bit of earwax~~ **massive chunk of yellow crud** stuck to them. It was absolutely vile. I didn't use them for the rest of the day, and I planned to clean them somehow when I got home. I did a bit of research and discovered that rubbing alcohol can be used to dissolve earwax and sterilize them.

(confusing time right now) is furious at me for missing pills and getting pregnant. I didn't want to get pregnant, it was a mistake and I regret it. I attempted to get an abortion but didnt go through with it. The dad is calling me a retard, a fuckup, a dumb bitch, a bad mother, and says that he loved me off and on and it didn't work out and keeping this baby is a huge mistake. He thinks I'm trying to trap him into marriage or something because I told him I don't want to raise a baby in a hostile enviroment with a man who doesn't love me and want me around. BUT he says the only way to make things work is to live together and raise the kid. I don't agree. I suggested I could move back to my home state to have my family help, and he got all pissy about it. He claims he's scared for the kid because if I can't remember to take a pill I won't remember other stuff for the kid. I don't do drugs, not an alcoholic, I have never had a kid before and after this mess I never want to again. It was a mistake and he's constantly rubbing it in my face, as if I don't know I fucked up and feel horrible about it already. I only kept the child because I feel guilty about abortion, and he said he wanted to always be a dad. Then he threw in my face he wants to be a dad, but maybe not with me.\n\nI don't want to live with a man who talks to me like this. I feel trapped. I can barely afford my own shit so he says it can only work if we live together and split bills.

(confusing time right now) is furious at me for missing pills and getting pregnant. I didn't want to get pregnant, it was a mistake and I regret it. I attempted to get an abortion but didnt go through with it. The dad is calling me a retard, a fuckup, a dumb bitch, a bad mother, and says that he loved me off and on and it didn't work out and keeping this baby is a huge mistake. He thinks I'm trying to trap him into marriage or something because I told him I don't want to raise a baby in a hostile enviroment with a man who doesn't love me and want me around. BUT he says the only way to make things work is to live together and raise the kid. I don't agree. I suggested I could move back to my home state to have my family help, and he got all pissy about it. He claims he's scared for the kid because if I can't remember to take a pill I won't remember other stuff for the kid. I don't do drugs, not an alcoholic, I have never had a kid before and after this mess I never want to again. It was a mistake and he's constantly rubbing it in my face, as if I don't know I fucked up and feel horrible about it already. I only kept the child because I feel guilty about abortion, and he said he wanted to always be a dad. Then he threw in my face he wants to be a dad, but maybe not with me.\n\nI don't want to live with a man who talks to me like this. I feel trapped. I can barely afford my own shit so he says it can only work if we live together and split bills. I know I'll not be able to stay there because I can't stand the thought of waking up next to a man who doesn't want me, that I have a child with.

It's not going well. As the title suggests, she's pissed at me. Whenever we speak, we can't speak about my life at Uni without her going in a mood. Speaking about her life is fine, she's happy and bubbly, but when I start telling her about my day she reverts to one-word 'hmms' and 'okays'. She freely admits this is because she's angry at me for going to Uni. She thinks I've abandoned her.\n\nI go to a very good Uni and it's really, really hard. A lot of work. I'm busy all the time. Of course some of that is social, but I think that's understandable when I've only been here two weeks and I'm trying to make friends. So yeah, I have been giving her less attention than when we were in the same city and I had only free time, but surely this is understandable?

I'm not going to give up my education, that's ridiculous. I don't think she'd want me to. She's being irrational like that, knowing I can't change the situation and being mad anyway.\n\nWe've spoken about the issue a lot and nothing changes.

It's not going well. As the title suggests, she's pissed at me. Whenever we speak, we can't speak about my life at Uni without her going in a mood. Speaking about her life is fine, she's happy and bubbly, but when I start telling her about my day she reverts to one-word 'hmms' and 'okays'.

Of course some of that is social, but I think that's understandable when I've only been here two weeks and I'm trying to make friends. So yeah, I have been giving her less attention than when we were in the same city and I had only free time, but surely this is understandable? The work also leaves me stressed, the calibre of people here makes me feel unworthy, and I can't talk to her about this without her getting in a huff.\n\nI'm being punished and, in my eyes, maybe you'll disagree, I haven't done anything wrong. I know once I go back home she'll be happy again but I don't what I can do whilst I'm here Train tickets are too expensive; we're both quite poor, especially me at the moment. \n\nI understand she's lonely without me there - I'm lonely too! - and I know she's being like this because she's sad, but I don't feel (like she does) that it's my fault. I'm not going to give up my education, that's ridiculous. I don't think she'd want me to. She's being irrational like that, knowing I can't change the situation and being mad anyway.\n\nWe've spoken about the issue a lot and nothing changes. She keeps saying she'll try, but she never does. It's really getting me down. Any advice? Any other students doing long distance?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

I want to get past this with her. i know people will say this is utter BS idea but i still love her and i don't want to let this situation end us.\n\nI need help reddit. Sorry for being a moany idiot but is there any way to salvage this? Does counselling work? How do i make sure this shit doesn't happen again? and wtf do I do about the psycho girl who has copies of all these photos? should I tell the groom that his bride was at it as well?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

They used to, with some faults, but after some time neither want to live with each other next year and I am stuck to chose who to live with.

After spending a few days in the hospital and having all the tests and such done and talking to a neurologist, it was decided that I shouldn't need to go on medication unless it happens again. At first it was believed that I was sleep-deprived and that's what triggered the seizure(s). After having a neurologist look at my MRI and such, I have what is called Gray Matter Heterotopia.\n\nAnyway...on March 29th (Tuesday morning) I had another seizure. It wasn't fully witnessed but it was extremely similar to what happened back in August; I was walking around all drunk-like, my brother said it was like I was getting ready to go to school--but I have absolutely no recollection of this. I have an appointment with a neurologist in a couple weeks, but I have a few questions for those who have \"experience\" or are knowledgeable on the topic. My first question being; is it normal after a seizure to feel sad/depressed/bummed out? It's been a few days and I feel like crap. Another question I have would be a generalized medication-related question. I'm not sure anyone would be able to answer it, but what sort of meds are used to treat seizures similar to what I have described?

Everything is great, however she wants to get super serious and is incredibly needy.\n\nShe can't handle me being unsatisfied or unhappy without completely turning into a wreck.  She's so afraid of losing me that she'll start crying and having panic attacks whenever I'm mad about something which gets pretty annoying.  Her neediness is also insane, for example I'll go to class where I lose cell service and when I get out I'll have 20 texts with her panicking apologizing thinking I'm ignoring her.  She seems to think that I \"saved her\" because she was depressed before she met me and now she's always happy and ecstatic most of the time.  Because of that she says things like how she'd kill herself if I ever left her.  It's ridiculous, and I don't know how she's going to be in the future.  \n\nI haven't been bothered by her neediness and occasional emotional outbursts, but she wants to get more serious.  She wants me to propose to her, and she wants kids within the next few years.  She's also wanting to move in with me when school ends in a month.  I don't know if her neediness is going to be problem or not for the future.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is serious. It is formal and lacks humor.\n2.

She has a High School Diploma though. She's held high jobs, both of which are 6-10 years and then had lower ones over 20 years ago (She's 52). We list the top two jobs since their most recent on her resume.  And no luck ever. She's had a handful of interviews. All of which obviously turned out well.\n\nAt this point, I'm stressed to my limit, crying, and unsure of what to do next. I haven't been able to save, especially for emergencies, just in case my dog needs to go to the vet, as well as for a cheap car (every time I need one, Zipcars cost to much but I have to deal with it), paying student loans, credit cards, etc. All I do is work to support myself and I'm becoming over-exhausted. My boyfriend of 16 months tries to help out when he can (but my pride really doesn't let him I hate it so much taking money from him) but I really need my mother to find a job. It's been demanding and is really taking a toll on my heath. I have no idea what to do next. \n\nCan anyone offer advice?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1.

We're pretty set on making it work and if we did, we have a pretty solid future planned out where we can live the life we both want. We're really solid when we're together and even when we're apart we're aware that at the end of the day it just works and it will work when we're reunited.

Anyways we've connected on so many levels. We also know that in the future we want very different things and there's some circumstances that make it pretty clear that we wouldn't work together. He acknowledges this and tells me that he wouldn't want me to ever leave my boyfriend because he can't personally give me what I want in my future where my boyfriend can. I also wouldn't fit in with his future.\nWe've had lots of discussions about this and he just reiterates that he realizes that it's not going to be easy seeing me with my boyfriend but he would rather have sometime together now and deal with that later than give up what we have now because like I said we're just so good together. I can't let myself give it up either. \nI know my boyfriend is my future. I know that we are compatible as hell and I do love him.

We're pretty set on making it work and if we did, we have a pretty solid future planned out where we can live the life we both want. We're really solid when we're together and even when we're apart we're aware that at the end of the day it just works and it will work when we're reunited. That being said, the long distance is tough and there have been times where we've been on and off.\n\nThats where the other guy comes in. He started off as a really good friend and we've been growing closer for the last 6 months or so. I know this is going to sound ridiculous to others because I couldn't even imagine feeling this way about something considering how set I thought I was with my boyfriend. Anyways we've connected on so many levels. We also know that in the future we want very different things and there's some circumstances that make it pretty clear that we wouldn't work together. He acknowledges this and tells me that he wouldn't want me to ever leave my boyfriend because he can't personally give me what I want in my future where my boyfriend can. I also wouldn't fit in with his future.\nWe've had lots of discussions about this and he just reiterates that he realizes that it's not going to be easy seeing me with my boyfriend but he would rather have sometime together now and deal with that later than give up what we have now because like I said we're just so good together. I can't let myself give it up either. \nI know my boyfriend is my future. I know that we are compatible as hell and I do love him.

We hit off very well back then, but a month into her working at my job, she started dating a guy. This past August, they broke up due to him cheating on her. We didn't keep in touch over the past three years, except with the occasional Facebook update. We reconnected this past September through a happy hour. She told a co-worker to tell me she was single now, and I ended up going back to her place that night after happy hour. Since then, we've been going several times. Last night, coming back from a date in public transportation, I saw that she and her ex were sending these super long text messages back and forth. I only looked down for a split second and saw his name and the few-lines-long green and gray text boxes.\n\nI figured most people delete the contact info of the person who committed infidelity, so it surprised me when I looked down on her phone and saw his name. We are keeping things pretty casual and organic, so we've not had The Talk or DTR at all, and so she does have every prerogative to speak with him. But it's making me hesitant to have The Talk and I don't know how to talk to her about her ex since she's never personally told me what happened about the relationship (I learned about the infidelity from the co-worker) and I've never asked.

We hit off very well back then, but a month into her working at my job, she started dating a guy. This past August, they broke up due to him cheating on her. We didn't keep in touch over the past three years, except with the occasional Facebook update. We reconnected this past September through a happy hour. She told a co-worker to tell me she was single now, and I ended up going back to her place that night after happy hour. Since then, we've been going several times. Last night, coming back from a date in public transportation, I saw that she and her ex were sending these super long text messages back and forth. I only looked down for a split second and saw his name and the few-lines-long green and gray text boxes.\n\nI figured most people delete the contact info of the person who committed infidelity, so it surprised me when I looked down on her phone and saw his name. We are keeping things pretty casual and organic, so we've not had The Talk or DTR at all, and so she does have every prerogative to speak with him. But it's making me hesitant to have The Talk and I don't know how to talk to her about her ex since she's never personally told me what happened about the relationship (I learned about the infidelity from the co-worker) and I've never asked.

I don't want him touching me etc. he has a problem with boundaries. Eg. Wednesday night he came to my house at 1.15AM to see me. Knocking on my window/wall till I came outside.  I hadn't checked FB so I didn't know he'd been trying to contact me (issue w his phone).  Overreaction on his part and it stressed me out. Today he tried to call me 6 times in a row over a 20min period. I feel like he's stalking me and won't leave me alone. \n\nI haven't seen him since Thursday. I have no desire to catch up or do anything with him, however, I need to break up with him. I need to do it in person, I don't feel like it's something that should be done over the phone. It's making me feel anxious when I think about him/the situation. \n\nThat being said I liked it when we first started going out and when we were just friends.

I was living with him for almost 7 months and we broke up 3 or 4 times in that time span.  It was always him breaking up with me and then begging me to take him back. I had enough of the ups and downs by May and moved out by the end of the month.  We hooked up about 2 weeks after I moved out and then he started dating this woman. She's older by 6 years and has an 11 year old kid. He never wanted children and now he's going to marry a woman with a child? I also wanted out of the relationship because of his alcohol and drug abuse and his sports gambling. I tried to help him as best I could but he didn't think he had any problems. As far as I can tell, he still has those problems. He got himself purposely fired when I moved in, didn't work until May, quit that job after 2 or 3 months, got hired at a new job in October, fired after the first 3 days and as far as I can tell hasn't had a job since. \n\nI found out about the engagement on Facebook. We were trying to be friends which is why I added him back after deleting him the first time. I immediately unfriended him when I saw he was engaged because I didnt want to see all of the \"congrats\" and comments. I read a few and many seemed surprised. The picture showed him wearing a ring but not her so I'm not sure who proposed or the details, just that they're engaged. \n\nI've moved on with my life, the best I could after such a serious relationship, and have been taking care of myself since the breakup.

I'm kind of in shock. Our relationship was great for the first 18 months and started getting rocky after that point. We had talked about getting married and starting a life together. I was living with him for almost 7 months and we broke up 3 or 4 times in that time span.  It was always him breaking up with me and then begging me to take him back. I had enough of the ups and downs by May and moved out by the end of the month.  We hooked up about 2 weeks after I moved out and then he started dating this woman. She's older by 6 years and has an 11 year old kid. He never wanted children and now he's going to marry a woman with a child? I also wanted out of the relationship because of his alcohol and drug abuse and his sports gambling. I tried to help him as best I could but he didn't think he had any problems. As far as I can tell, he still has those problems. He got himself purposely fired when I moved in, didn't work until May, quit that job after 2 or 3 months, got hired at a new job in October, fired after the first 3 days and as far as I can tell hasn't had a job since. \n\nI found out about the engagement on Facebook. We were trying to be friends which is why I added him back after deleting him the first time. I immediately unfriended him when I saw he was engaged because I didnt want to see all of the \"congrats\" and comments. I read a few and many seemed surprised. The picture showed him wearing a ring but not her so I'm not sure who proposed or the details, just that they're engaged. \n\nI've moved on with my life, the best I could after such a serious relationship, and have been taking care of myself since the breakup. I've been working on myself, been out on dates and have been working on my hobbies. I don't want him back, not in the least, but then why does it hurt and anger me to know he's gotten engaged? Is this the real deal?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2. Is funny.

I was so sure that we were getting married and that we are technically a old couple together already, to the point that we don't need words to express how much we love each other. \n\nShe apparently thought that we were drifting apart and decided to call it quits 4 months",

I barely have enough space for my stuff, so I can't even imagine what it must be like to fit a family of three in there. Still, it doesn't seem to have been a problem for them until a few weeks ago, when the parents started having extremely loud fights where the mom would be screaming (in a foreign language I understand a few words of, so I don't really know what about) for up to an hour, then stuff would quiet down.\n\nThe problem is that in recent days, the intensity of the fighting has increased to where I feel my walls and floor shake when they fight, which suggests to me that they're slamming stuff around. The sounds are correlated with the mom's screaming, so I'm worried she's either getting hit or hitting her husband or their kid or something. The kicker is that the kid actually called the cops on his parents a few weeks ago (I heard the interaction through my thin walls) because he was scared, but nothing ended up happening. I called the police too a few days ago because the screaming was worse than it has ever been, and I heard very distinct slapping/punching noises and the mom was screaming/sobbing \"why???\" over and over again.

Maybe I havnt given it enough time but I really miss my ex.  \n\nI'm currently thinking I want to tell my ex that I may have made a mistake but I need more time to figure it out.  Maybe I'll keep looking for this girl and maybe she doesn't exist and I'll go back to me ex, because she really is a great girl.  Or maybe I'll find this girl I'm looking for.

Basically, before the exam starts, we are meant to put all electrical devices (i.e. phones) into a plastic wallet, and the examiners collect them in. This boy behind me (let's call him Ryan) does not put anything in his wallet. This is odd because I have seen him walking out of school after an exam using his phone, so clearly it is in his pocket. At every single exam we have had so far (there have been 6) he has asked to get up and go to the toilet. Obviously, an examiner goes with him, but they obviously cannot follow him into the cubical, and I am certain that he is checking the answers on his phone. He has asked to go to the toilet in EVERY SINGLE exam we have had, usually 10 minutes after the exam starts. He doesn't have any medical issues that would result in him needing the toilet this often, as I was in lessons with him throughout the year and he never went to the toilet frequently then - and that was only a week ago, so I'm sure nothing drastic has changed.

They left and I rushed to the bathroom for a mirror, I was trying to find somthing to be made fun off, but couln't figure something out. \n\nJust went to bed after with so many thoughts passing through my mind. \n\nI feel like I'm going crazy or my friends are really just mocking me around behind my back or even in front of me and it's killing me.\n\nI don't know what to do, what to say, what to ask....\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

Everyone is talking about how they think you're cheating on me. You can't just break up with me before going off and flirting with other girls?\n\nThis is when I called her. I asked her if she was kidding and she said yes, but she sounded upset and when I said that she freaked me out she just said \"whatever.\"  \n\nWe kept texting after that.\n\nMe: I would never cheat on you.

We hit it off instantly. I was working and she came into my restaurant. Before even introducing or even talking with her, I saved her from being hit on by a lesbian by pretending to be her boyfriend and asking her out for a cigarette. Went off without a hitch and we ended up talking outside for about 45 minutes and exchanged numbers. From that moment on we talked/texted at least once a day always asking how each others day was and exchanging witty banter.

We hit it off instantly. I was working and she came into my restaurant. Before even introducing or even talking with her, I saved her from being hit on by a lesbian by pretending to be her boyfriend and asking her out for a cigarette. Went off without a hitch and we ended up talking outside for about 45 minutes and exchanged numbers. From that moment on we talked/texted at least once a day always asking how each others day was and exchanging witty banter.

During that year was my most emotionally satisfying and stable portion of my life that we both enjoyed to no end.  When she was offered a position that would almost double her compensation, I could never ask her to stay and knew that I wasn't going to deal with long distance well.  We spoke before she left about how we would just try to be friends while she was away and move on romantically.\n\nWe spoke on and off during the next 1.5 years and it was not quite a friendship and not quite a relationship, we definitely never really moved on, but technically both saw other people.  I was then offered a job in a new location and only six months later she also moved to the location for a different job.\n\nNow that we're in the same place, it is both right and weird all over again.  We connect well on some things, but I find that we're different people now and sometimes it feels like I have solidified more of what I want in life and she is more content in making us work and following my goals and less concerned about her/our potential mutual ones.

May 2014 when I stumbled upon some erotic novels on the internet while I was on my phone. Didn't think much of it at first and just went about my day until I found the site again when I was on the computer and started going through all of the other novels that were on that website. \n\nI masturbated to the novels and I thought they were interesting to read. Then my curiosity began to grow on weird Youtube Videos with kids in the pool. Once I realized what I was doing I was/still am disgusted with myself for what I am doing.

We met online and were chatting for a week or so and getting along quite well. I asked her out and she said yes.\n\nFast forward to last night and we meet in a bar and go for dinner. During the date I became aware that she wore a lot of fake tan. So much that her skin was kind of orange. Obviously she had made an effort so I didn't bring it up, and we went on to have a pretty good date.\n\nWe live quite close so after the date I shared a cab with her, and when it pulled up to her place she asked me in, to which I said no.\n\nI've since had a text apologizing for asking me to come in, and that she's not the type to sleep with someone on a first date normally but she felt we had got along well so she wanted to carry on the date. \n\nThe truth in the matter is that I don't care about the whole first date thing. It's just some silly rule that's been made up and if I'd liked her I'd have obliged. \n\nWhat I do care about is the fake tan. I'm not the best looking guy in the world, but I never try to fake what I look like. She was a good looking lass, but the fake tan thing really put me off. When a girl wears it, it makes me think she's self obsessed or fake.

I am now happily single and haven't missed my ex very much, if at all. \n\nSo why am I crushed at the thought of her meeting someone else?\n\nI haven't really thought seriously about her since the break up, and I deleted/blocked her on all social media and my phone for a quicker healing process. I had been growing more and more distant from her until finally breaking off our relationship, so I think that explains how nonchalantly I have been handling the lack of contact. But the thought of her meeting another guy, and becoming romantic/sexual with him makes my blood boil. Also, I am deeply hurt by the thought of her drinking/going to bars now, since I am a teetotaler and she kept alcoholic intake to a minimum during our relationship. \n\nPlease help me to overcome my irrational jealousy and heartache at the thought of her putting herself back out there. I am obviously trying to do the same thing, so why am I so irrational about her doing it, too?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is funny. It includes humor and jokes.\n2. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n\nfunny and long summary of the POST: ",

You will stay here since we do not know you yet.\" These folks had a bit of a rep. as trashy but I had no previous problems with them (through baseball/community events) and I was excited to be doing date type stuff.\n\nHighlights (her parents):\n\nDad keep giving me body shots (decently hard ones) and says \"What's wrong boy? Too hard for ya girl?\"\n\nDad keeps pushing me from behind into things and cracking up\n\nDad kick me in the ass three times during the evening\n\nDad asks my opinion on something then interjects with \"Well who cares what you think dummy\"\n\nDad kept throwing paper/popcorn/dirty socks at me\n\nMom asks me \"So are you poor or rich?\"\n\nMom gives me a generic soda and everyone else a brand name (not that I cared) what I did not know was that she was shaking the hell out of it before handing it over. She then told me I \"could only have water if drinking was too difficult\".\n\nMom says \"How many times a week do you attend church\" (1 was not a good answer)\n\nMom asks \"Are you parents divorced and are you adopted?\"\n\nMom asks \"Do you like peanut butter cookies\" I say \"No I am allergic to peanutes\". She says \"Well in the future I'll have to make them for you with extra peanuts.\"\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is serious. It is formal and lacks humor.\n2.

I found this out because I saw his Instagram bio with her name and a heart next to it and when I questioned, everything went to crap. This girl was my first love and was pretty much the first girl who had feelings for me too. We were best friends before we had feelings for each other. This guy was a total butt, he cheated on her and treated her terribly. \n\nI didn't find out until afterward but this guy came crawling back to her just when school was about to start up again (I'm guessing because he couldn't stand being single at school) and she told him about me and how I treated her right.

My ex and best friend fucked each other not 2 months after we broke up. Even though it wasn't technically cheating, it has hurt me like nothing else before in my life. I got no contact from my best friend after it happened either, and learned not to long ago that he believes he did absolutely nothing wrong. Needless to say, he is not my friend anymore and he will never be in my life again.\n\nFast forward to today, where some of my other friends from out of town are here for the holidays. They know about the situation and what happened. One of them still goes and hangs out with *them* almost every night now that he's in town. Now, they are having a new years eve party tonight, and texted me telling me that they are inviting everyone, including (lets call them) Betty and John.

I was in Philadelphia visiting colleges with, my mom and my sister, as I was a high school senior. After the long winded presentation/tour at Drexel and Temple really made me and my family hungry. We went to eat.\n\nFinally, we decided that it is time to head back to the big train station in Philly and board a train back home. My bladder, however, was about to explode. I excuse myself to go use the bathroom. I ask an employee where the nearest restroom is and he directs me to it. On my approach, I see a kid, around 9 or 10, with a Phillies hat run past me with a panicked look on his face. I think practically nothing of it and go to use the bathroom. My urination went normally but as I walk out, I see a lady run toward me. She asks in a hurried breath if I had seen her son. She goes on to describe him to be exactly the kid I had seen.

I was in Philadelphia visiting colleges with, my mom and my sister, as I was a high school senior. After the long winded presentation/tour at Drexel and Temple really made me and my family hungry. We went to eat.\n\nFinally, we decided that it is time to head back to the big train station in Philly and board a train back home. My bladder, however, was about to explode. I excuse myself to go use the bathroom. I ask an employee where the nearest restroom is and he directs me to it. On my approach, I see a kid, around 9 or 10, with a Phillies hat run past me with a panicked look on his face. I think practically nothing of it and go to use the bathroom. My urination went normally but as I walk out, I see a lady run toward me. She asks in a hurried breath if I had seen her son. She goes on to describe him to be exactly the kid I had seen. For no reason whatsoever I said calmly \"no\" and treated her like she was bothering me. Right after as she thanked me and sprinted away, I knew I fucked up.

We own a house together and things are generally good. We share his laptop computer and I stumbled upon nude photos of his most recent ex girlfriend while searching for photos from one of our trips. (She clearly was posing for the photos so she knows they exist.) I was shocked to see these photos. I know he has dozens of photos of her from their past (and those I don't mind), but to keep nude photos seems to be crossing a line, especially three years into our relationship.  \n\nI mentioned that I had seen them and told him that I felt pretty hurt that he had kept these. He told me he didn't even remember they were there, but I'm also pretty sure he hasn't deleted them since that conversation, though I haven't checked. \n\nWhy this is a problem now? On a recent trip back to his hometown, he asked mutual friends of his and his ex about what she was up to. He asked this in front of me. (I guess I should be glad that he was open about it?) I felt, and still feel, that it was really disrespectful. Since this happened, the whole nude photo thing has reared its head in my mind. \n\nHow offended should I be? Is it normal to keep nude photos of an ex for this long? How disrespectful is he being by keeping them? I'm not exactly jealous of her; I'm more concerned that I'm being walked all over and am worried I'm not respecting myself enough by putting up with this.

We own a house together and things are generally good. We share his laptop computer and I stumbled upon nude photos of his most recent ex girlfriend while searching for photos from one of our trips. (She clearly was posing for the photos so she knows they exist.) I was shocked to see these photos. I know he has dozens of photos of her from their past (and those I don't mind), but to keep nude photos seems to be crossing a line, especially three years into our relationship.  \n\nI mentioned that I had seen them and told him that I felt pretty hurt that he had kept these. He told me he didn't even remember they were there, but I'm also pretty sure he hasn't deleted them since that conversation, though I haven't checked. \n\nWhy this is a problem now? On a recent trip back to his hometown, he asked mutual friends of his and his ex about what she was up to. He asked this in front of me. (I guess I should be glad that he was open about it?) I felt, and still feel, that it was really disrespectful. Since this happened, the whole nude photo thing has reared its head in my mind. \n\nHow offended should I be? Is it normal to keep nude photos of an ex for this long? How disrespectful is he being by keeping them? I'm not exactly jealous of her; I'm more concerned that I'm being walked all over and am worried I'm not respecting myself enough by putting up with this.

It was his second round of school so he was ten years older than me, but we honestly got along so well. Eventually we moved in together and it was great! No complaints and we only stopped living together when he got a job out of state. \n\nSometimes when we lived together we would throw wine parties and I remember he once asked me if him and his friends could have a couple of my adderall. I was taking them for ADHD while in school. I said sure and gave them to him.\n\nAnother party my whole bottle went missing, but he claimed it must have been someone at the party. It ended up costing me around $400 to replace.\n\nAbout five years has gone by and throughout that time he'd become the friend who was always fixing someone. He likes being the hero. But it comes at the expense of his true friends who are there for him and often times he would choose deadbeats over true friends. One example is missing half my wedding to attend the funeral of a mom of a distant old high school friend. I wasn't mad but I noticed his choice. \n\nAnyways. My last straw recently was finding out that he was bragging to friends in a bar about how he would steal my adderall when we lived together and snort it with friends. Than they would put sugar back in the capsules so I wouldn't be any wiser. Also they laughed about how he could tell when I took one of the sugar pills. Who knows what else he did while we lived together. I really trusted him. \n\ni confronted him and to,d him to leave me alone and not talk to him for a while and have not heard a peep. I dont miss him much to be honest, I've gotten used to him not showing up in life lately. I heard from a friend he's ashamed but I don't care really.

No complaints and we only stopped living together when he got a job out of state. \n\nSometimes when we lived together we would throw wine parties and I remember he once asked me if him and his friends could have a couple of my adderall.

But it comes at the expense of his true friends who are there for him and often times he would choose deadbeats over true friends. One example is missing half my wedding to attend the funeral of a mom of a distant old high school friend. I wasn't mad but I noticed his choice. \n\nAnyways. My last straw recently was finding out that he was bragging to friends in a bar about how he would steal my adderall when we lived together and snort it with friends. Than they would put sugar back in the capsules so I wouldn't be any wiser. Also they laughed about how he could tell when I took one of the sugar pills. Who knows what else he did while we lived together. I really trusted him. \n\ni confronted him and to,d him to leave me alone and not talk to him for a while and have not heard a peep. I dont miss him much to be honest, I've gotten used to him not showing up in life lately. I heard from a friend he's ashamed but I don't care really. Am I immature for ending one of my greatest friendships over something that happened so long ago?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long.

I am an LBK (left below knee) amputee and have been one for the past 9 years. How and why it happened doesn't really matter but it was after a lot of surgeries and a congenital problem. I wear a prosthesis and have a pretty active lifestyle. This incident happened around 8 years ago, back when I was still in school and had recently gotten fitted with a prosthesis. I was still getting used to it and also had the problem of the grip loosening a bit every time I walked too much because of the all the sweat.\n\nI am a huge football fan(soccer to you Americans) and although I don't really play much, I do watch a lot of it. So I was wandering near the school football ground watching other kids play when all of a sudden this really juicy looking ball came rolling towards me begging to be kicked. Now because of the artificial leg and being a naturally left footed person I always felt I could kick with the maximum power possible. And so I did, sending the ball flying back towards the players. But along with the ball, my leg went flying across the field in the other direction narrowly missing a kids head.\n\nEverybody froze for a moment after that as I frantically hopped towards my prosthesis. It was thee most awkward moment of my life as every single eye was on me and people staring was still something that I was not fully used to as an amputee yet.

I wear a prosthesis and have a pretty active lifestyle. This incident happened around 8 years ago, back when I was still in school and had recently gotten fitted with a prosthesis.

So I was wandering near the school football ground watching other kids play when all of a sudden this really juicy looking ball came rolling towards me begging to be kicked. Now because of the artificial leg and being a naturally left footed person I always felt I could kick with the maximum power possible. And so I did, sending the ball flying back towards the players. But along with the ball, my leg went flying across the field in the other direction narrowly missing a kids head.\n\nEverybody froze for a moment after that as I frantically hopped towards my prosthesis. It was thee most awkward moment of my life as every single eye was on me and people staring was still something that I was not fully used to as an amputee yet.

No jealousy for any of us and everyone really enjoyed themselves.  \n\nMy problem is that I can't stop thinking about the girl.  I'm not really thinking about her in a star-struck lovey-dovey kind of way, but in a way that I seem to seek her attention and affection.  Obviously, this is a problem to feel that way about a married woman in a relationship that only brings people in for sex and not polyamory.  \n\nSo I'm trying to figure out why I feel this way about her.  I obviously find her attractive and we get along well, but it's clear that it's just sex to both of them (as was explicitly stated before we did anything).  I cognitively understand my feelings are misplaced and, to be frank, I'm not even sure what those feelings are, I just find myself thinking about her often. My goal is to try to understand and reconcile these emotional feelings with the rational side of me that recognizes the healthiest way to interact with the couple is to have me not be involved.\n\nSo, I have two questions.  First, how can I understand and eventually reconcile my feelings for this woman?  I very much enjoyed the threeway and their company and would hate to have stupid emotions get in the way.  Second, why is it that I felt like this in the first place?  I knew that it was going to be just for sex, but I still feel like I expected more.

No jealousy for any of us and everyone really enjoyed themselves.  \n\nMy problem is that I can't stop thinking about the girl.  I'm not really thinking about her in a star-struck lovey-dovey kind of way, but in a way that I seem to seek her attention and affection.  Obviously, this is a problem to feel that way about a married woman in a relationship that only brings people in for sex and not polyamory.  \n\nSo I'm trying to figure out why I feel this way about her.  I obviously find her attractive and we get along well, but it's clear that it's just sex to both of them (as was explicitly stated before we did anything).  I cognitively understand my feelings are misplaced and, to be frank, I'm not even sure what those feelings are, I just find myself thinking about her often. My goal is to try to understand and reconcile these emotional feelings with the rational side of me that recognizes the healthiest way to interact with the couple is to have me not be involved.\n\nSo, I have two questions.  First, how can I understand and eventually reconcile my feelings for this woman?  I very much enjoyed the threeway and their company and would hate to have stupid emotions get in the way.  Second, why is it that I felt like this in the first place?  I knew that it was going to be just for sex, but I still feel like I expected more.  Any help / comments / suggestions would be much appreciated!  :)\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is serious. It is formal and lacks humor.\n2. Is long.

We've been having sex since then, and now she lives with me.  However, she's been having a lot of anxiety about us and we've been attending church more frequently now that I graduated.

According to him, he just doesn't do worry.\n\nWhen I asked him how he felt when I told him I loved him, he said that it was really scary. I asked if he was happy too, and he said yes. However, he admitted that he wasn't incandescently, \"eudaimonia-level\" happiness.\n\nI've written him poems, made him playlists and necklaces, but he hasn't reciprocated those things. He says he mostly focuses on doing activities together rather than doing things for each other separately.\n\nNow, I know that I'm quite head-over-heels in love with him. We have good communication and we make each other laugh. Yet I can't help but think that when I say 'I love you', he feels obligated to reply and say 'I love you' without actually meaning it. I'm wondering if I can handle this feeling I have that I care more for him than he does for me. \n\nShould I stick it out, and if so is there anything I can do to help him figure out what he feels for me? Obviously I can't 'make' him fall in love, but can I help him clarify his feelings?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long.

I was fine with this because my boyfriend assured me she would not sleep over because I told him that it made me uncomfortable.

We have been together for a little over a year. \n\nThis weekend one of my boyfriend's friends from high school, Emily, came down to visit our college with a group of her friends. This was my first time meeting her, she seems really nice, and she has a long distance boyfriend of around three years. Last night started out with me studying at the library until about 10pm because I have an exam next week. Emily came in during the afternoon and has been spending time with my boyfriend and some of their other high school friends. After I got enough work done, I joined Emily and bf and we went out to bf's frat last night. \n\nShe was supposed to spend last night at a hotel with her friends, but instead she ended up staying with my boyfriend and I at his frat until around 3 am. Upon leaving his frat, I went back to my apartment because I had work this morning and he went back to his apartment with Emily so they could continue to catch up. I was fine with this because my boyfriend assured me she would not sleep over because I told him that it made me uncomfortable. He said something to the effect of \"I love you and would never cheat on you.\"\n\nHe says that they were chatting and it got really late and they both ended up really tired so he tried to be a nice guy and he let her stay over. She slept in his bed, and he slept on the couch. I feel extremely disrespected because he allowed her to spend the night even though I told him it made me uncomfortable beforehand, and doubly so because he allowed another woman to sleep in his bed and I think that's extremely inappropriate. I don't think he would cheat on me and she and I got along really well while all of us were hanging out. My boyfriend says he was just trying to be a nice guy and not inconvenience his friend, but this makes me feel even worse because that means convenience for her was put above my feelings which I don't think were unreasonable. \n\nWhat do I do reddit?

I only had 1 or 2 friends since no one else in the building was around my age. We all became really good friends after some time since we had some things in common.\n\nTo the actual fuck-up now. Being small, I was always curious about one thing or the other, which got the good of me.\n\nMy Dad and Mom were going out for regular shopping and all, and I decided to stay back with my friend at my place. As my Dad was in a hurry a bit, he forgot to take a 20 Dinar note he had kept in the shelf along side his wallet, he obviously took his wallet but didn't notice the note kept along side it since he was in a hurry.\n\nNow that piece of money got me really intrigued, I always wondered what if I could get that cash and keep it all to myself! Imagine the things I could do! Me being the little 10 yr old bitch, excuse my self from my friend for a bit, and silently keep the note in my pocket. Mind you it was 20 Dinar(Bahrain's Currency), which is a lot of money.\n\nMy Dad is mostly particular about money and when he comes back, he searches for the note in the shelf. He asks my Mom if she knows where it was but to no avail. I literally turned into a pussy lol and was shivering to death inside. I didn't have the guts to spill it out. My Dad kept on thinking maybe he spent somewhere and what not but he eventually gave up.\n\nRemember the note is still in my pants and I completely forgot about it that night and slept off.

I only had 1 or 2 friends since no one else in the building was around my age. We all became really good friends after some time since we had some things in common.\n\nTo the actual fuck-up now. Being small, I was always curious about one thing or the other, which got the good of me.\n\nMy Dad and Mom were going out for regular shopping and all, and I decided to stay back with my friend at my place. As my Dad was in a hurry a bit, he forgot to take a 20 Dinar note he had kept in the shelf along side his wallet, he obviously took his wallet but didn't notice the note kept along side it since he was in a hurry.\n\nNow that piece of money got me really intrigued, I always wondered what if I could get that cash and keep it all to myself! Imagine the things I could do! Me being the little 10 yr old bitch, excuse my self from my friend for a bit, and silently keep the note in my pocket. Mind you it was 20 Dinar(Bahrain's Currency), which is a lot of money.\n\nMy Dad is mostly particular about money and when he comes back, he searches for the note in the shelf. He asks my Mom if she knows where it was but to no avail. I literally turned into a pussy lol and was shivering to death inside. I didn't have the guts to spill it out. My Dad kept on thinking maybe he spent somewhere and what not but he eventually gave up.\n\nRemember the note is still in my pants and I completely forgot about it that night and slept off. The next day, it's laundry time, my pockets are checked by Mom always because I tend to keep chocolate wrappers and whatnot in my pockets. \n\nGone. Mom finds the note. Tells about it to Dad.

Thank the fucking lord after putting posters up and getting her picture shared all over Facebook I got a call from someone a few blocks down who had her cowering on their porch. I have never been so sad, hungover, and happy all in one day. I felt like I found out both my parents had cancer only to get a call from the doctor an hour later saying \"whoopsies no cancer my b dude lol.\" I know this wasn't funny or particularly interesting but any fellow dog owners out their will understand what an emotional rollercoaster this was. I promptly bought a GPS collar the second I got her back.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2. Is serious.

So I try to keep the lines of communication with him as open as possible. He's not great at communication... He doesn't like telling me when he's upset about things because he doesn't want to upset me, or bother me. Which I've told him countless times that if something is wrong, I want to now. I want to help. So with wanting to keep communication open, I ask him a lot of questions... Like if he is still attracted to me, and that I've heard of many people in long term relationships losing those feelings for each other/one of them losing it. I'll ask if he regrets \"settling\" down so young, if he wishes he was able to sleep around in college (I was not his first. I was the third person that he had sex with. He was my first). I ask him about other women he thinks are attractive (which he to this day claims are none, lol despite the fact that 2 years ago he thought Jennifer Lawrence was more attractive than me -WHICH OF COURSE SHE IS- but apparently now she isn't. ) All in all, I just ask him a lot of questions - kind of to clarify that we're both on the same page. \n\nI'm worried that by asking all these questions I'm pushing him away, and sabotaging our relationship.

And now are both back home, planning on moving in together again (we lived together throughout college in the town we went to school in) and getting married in 2018. \n\nI always hear horror stories on here about high school sweethearts and them cheating/wanting other things and what not. So I try to keep the lines of communication with him as open as possible. He's not great at communication... He doesn't like telling me when he's upset about things because he doesn't want to upset me, or bother me. Which I've told him countless times that if something is wrong, I want to now. I want to help. So with wanting to keep communication open, I ask him a lot of questions... Like if he is still attracted to me, and that I've heard of many people in long term relationships losing those feelings for each other/one of them losing it. I'll ask if he regrets \"settling\" down so young, if he wishes he was able to sleep around in college (I was not his first. I was the third person that he had sex with. He was my first). I ask him about other women he thinks are attractive (which he to this day claims are none, lol despite the fact that 2 years ago he thought Jennifer Lawrence was more attractive than me -WHICH OF COURSE SHE IS- but apparently now she isn't. ) All in all, I just ask him a lot of questions - kind of to clarify that we're both on the same page. \n\nI'm worried that by asking all these questions I'm pushing him away, and sabotaging our relationship. I'm a very insecure and anxious person and I'm not sure how to stop doing this or how to stop worrying that we'll be like the statistics.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2. Is funny. It includes humor and jokes.\n\nlong and funny summary of the POST: ",

I let it go at the time because I guess I just wanted to be good with her, but now it is bothering me so much. \n\nWhy just his thread? She has messages from last year and yet his thread was erased.

We had a lot of fights and some of them were caused because of my jealousy. \n\nShe is pretty close with her coworker as they get along very well, and he has made it clear that he was interested in her before we started dating. Anyways fast forward to last night, I had a sneaking suspicion that something was up, and so I went through her texts. I know that they text each other because they are on the same staff, yet the last message sent was two days ago. Obviously she erased their previous conversation because they have been working together since August. I confronted her and she very calmly said she erases her messages sometimes. I let it go at the time because I guess I just wanted to be good with her, but now it is bothering me so much. \n\nWhy just his thread? She has messages from last year and yet his thread was erased. Not sure on how I should approach this. I dropped it because I thought I was being irrational but I don't know. I also know it was wrong of me to go through her phone. She was upset but not too upset about that.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2. Is serious.

I do love her, I want the best for her. Recently there has been a lot of tension between us because while I am a senior in high school, she is a junior in high school. \n\nThroughout most of the relationship I had been making a mistake: I had not been including her in my life in the same way she included me in hers.

I am the kind of person who is scared to upset people but I end up upsetting myself because I just trap myself in situations to please someone else. This is both of our first relationships and she has severe trust issues. I tell her that she can trust me and that is one of the biggest reasons I can't ever bring myself to do anything about it because I don't want to ruin her already damaged trust.

A distant family member, someone who I've maybe met once or twice in my life is sick and about to pass away. My father, upon hearing this news immediately jumped on a plane and flew across the country to visit.\n\nThis all came very unexpectedly because as I've said, this is not a person I really knew growing up. I had to ask my father how he was related to us because I didn't even recognize his name. My father rarely visited or kept in contact with his family when I was a kid except for a few cousins. So I was shocked that he flew out here, considering he has to so carefully plan his visits here that he missed my college graduation.\n\nSo aside from my admittedly petty bitterness about my dad's traveling schedule, he is insisting that I come with him to visit this relative after I get off work tonight. I'm currently on the second day of a six day, possibly seven day work week, and I work 12 hours a day. This visit would also require a two hour roundtrip, aside from the painfully awkward small talk time I would have to sit through for possibly hours on end. I simply do not want to go. I'm tired and stressed. I barely know this man and his family, and I just went through an incredibly difficult ordeal last month dealing with the loss of my grandmother. I'm too emotionally exhausted to deal with this kind of thing right now, and I seriously doubt my presence would be missed. I feel like my father just wants to show me off, despite the fact that he has little to do with my accomplishments.\n \nSo am I a terrible person for not wanting to go? I should add that I do feel a bit guilty about not making the time to spend with my father, but whenever he comes to visit he routinely asks me to keep entire days free so that we can spend time together, but then blows me off because he gets too stoned to function.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

A distant family member, someone who I've maybe met once or twice in my life is sick and about to pass away. My father, upon hearing this news immediately jumped on a plane and flew across the country to visit.\n\nThis all came very unexpectedly because as I've said, this is not a person I really knew growing up. I had to ask my father how he was related to us because I didn't even recognize his name. My father rarely visited or kept in contact with his family when I was a kid except for a few cousins. So I was shocked that he flew out here, considering he has to so carefully plan his visits here that he missed my college graduation.\n\nSo aside from my admittedly petty bitterness about my dad's traveling schedule, he is insisting that I come with him to visit this relative after I get off work tonight. I'm currently on the second day of a six day, possibly seven day work week, and I work 12 hours a day. This visit would also require a two hour roundtrip, aside from the painfully awkward small talk time I would have to sit through for possibly hours on end. I simply do not want to go. I'm tired and stressed. I barely know this man and his family, and I just went through an incredibly difficult ordeal last month dealing with the loss of my grandmother. I'm too emotionally exhausted to deal with this kind of thing right now, and I seriously doubt my presence would be missed. I feel like my father just wants to show me off, despite the fact that he has little to do with my accomplishments.\n \nSo am I a terrible person for not wanting to go? I should add that I do feel a bit guilty about not making the time to spend with my father, but whenever he comes to visit he routinely asks me to keep entire days free so that we can spend time together, but then blows me off because he gets too stoned to function.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.

My bachelor party is this weekend and we have been planning it since Feb. My friends run the spectrum as far as incomes go from completely unemployed to making 6 figures. I knew that going in, so i made sure to ask everyone multiple times if they could make it, and made sure to impart that declining was not a slight in any way etc.\n\nI also made sure that the party would be super budget friendly (200.00PP all inclusive for a weekend at a cabin), and am throwing my own money in to help out so that everyone could attend.\n\nAt this point, 1 person has not paid at all. I have texted and texted and called and he keeps dodging me (we've been friends for 8 years), and finally i got a hold of him and he said he has the money and asked to just give me the cash when we meet up on friday. This would normally be fine, but this guy is HORRIBLE with money, hes unemployed and also puts things off forever.

(I had been 225 before but this was a rugby season a few years ago and was in a lot better shape)\n\nSo come January I got on to Keto, it was perfect diet for me at the time (lost 25 pounds on it) after 6 weeks I had started going to the gym and rugby training and I couldn't stand how fast I would fatigue during longer workouts so I changed to a low carb (-120g's a day) with a high protein content. By summer I was 185, looking strong with a little gut but my back and arm were huge.\n\n2 games into the season I broke a rib and some cartilage so I was back to not moving for a bit, I gained 10 pounds in a month and realized what slope I was going down so started limiting my self to 2000 cals a day. \n\nFirst game back and I break my hand so once again no lifting but I was still training rugby and watching what I eat. Get down to 185 again and school starts. I hit 180 after rugby season started (2 practices a day!) but once the cafe opened up to us I was back up to 190. End of september I started limiting my self to 1 plate per meal and i've been losing 1-2lbs per week since.\n\nI started the gym again 2 weeks ago where I weighted my self at 173 how ever I broke my hand again this weekend (no more rum) but I can hold about 45 pounds in it so it won't be as bad as last time.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is long. It includes details and redundancy.\n2. Is funny. It includes humor and jokes.\n\nfunny and long summary of the POST: ",

I've dated, had a couple flings, some casual relationships, but only 4 real in depth relationships. However, in all 4, I've been cheated on. Some worse than others, but the consistant thing remains that I've been cheated on.\nNow, I am in a relationship with a great woman who is kind to me, seems honest, and actually cares about me. But no matter how hard I try, I can't get over the fact that I just assume she will cheat on me. It creeps up on me. At first it's a soft voice telling me that she's going to hurt me, and it gets louder and the only way I can silence it is to do horrible things like check her phone texts and Facebook messages.\nWhen I do these things, even the most basic of conversations suddenly turn sexual in my head. And anything with a sexual overtone just feels like a betrayal all over again (i.e. the worst thing I've seen is her telling her ex that she had sexual dreams about him). I then just upset and moody and just hurt even though I have no real reason to.\nI know that looking in her phone and Facebook is a horrible and fucked up thing to do, and I already feel like shit about it, so no lectures please on all of that. I guess the advice I'm looking for is to those that have been cheated on, more than once especially, how do/did you get over it and learn to trust someone again?

I've dated, had a couple flings, some casual relationships, but only 4 real in depth relationships. However, in all 4, I've been cheated on. Some worse than others, but the consistant thing remains that I've been cheated on.\nNow, I am in a relationship with a great woman who is kind to me, seems honest, and actually cares about me. But no matter how hard I try, I can't get over the fact that I just assume she will cheat on me. It creeps up on me. At first it's a soft voice telling me that she's going to hurt me, and it gets louder and the only way I can silence it is to do horrible things like check her phone texts and Facebook messages.\nWhen I do these things, even the most basic of conversations suddenly turn sexual in my head. And anything with a sexual overtone just feels like a betrayal all over again (i.e. the worst thing I've seen is her telling her ex that she had sexual dreams about him). I then just upset and moody and just hurt even though I have no real reason to.\nI know that looking in her phone and Facebook is a horrible and fucked up thing to do, and I already feel like shit about it, so no lectures please on all of that. I guess the advice I'm looking for is to those that have been cheated on, more than once especially, how do/did you get over it and learn to trust someone again? How do/did you move on when you've been hurt time and time again by your significant other who always swears they won't cheat?\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1.

I see A around  and we are still good friends, but my little crush seems to have faded, that is, until we spent some time alone after a club meeting. She opened up to me about some guy she was seeing but was conflicted about their relationship. This was the first time we had a serious heart to heart, and it felt great. It was like taking a sip from a delicious cup of tea but having to leave the rest on the table. \n\nThis was last week and I have been thinking about her nonstop. These feelings frighten me because I DO love my girlfriend, but I also crave more time with A. Sometimes I feel like I've been emotionally cheating on her and it feels awful.\n\nI guess my question is...\n\nDo you guys think I should wait out these feelings and see if they go away? Any advise or input is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST. Importantly, the summary:\n1. Is funny. It includes humor and jokes.\n2. Is long.

I have had three relationships across my life so far. I am in my senior year of high school. Almost two years back, I met my current girlfriend. About two weeks previous to me asking her out, I was about to start a relationship with a girl who had made it obvious that she really wanted to be with me, but neither of us had said it out loud. Enter my (not yet) girlfriend.  \n  \nShe is everything I want and more. She has a great personality. She's very considerate. She's really funny. She's a gamer and a geek. She's extremely intelligent. She's kinky in the same way I am. She's everything I want... but too soon.  \n  \nThroughout our (almost two years now) relationship, she had brought up her (many) past relationships. She brought up her sex life. She brought everything up that could have made me curious of what I never had.  \nShe is head-over-heels for me. She recently began discussing that she wants our relationship to continue long-distance if we both go off to college, hoping to settle down eventually. But I am still too curious about the relationships I could have had. I'm curious about the relationship that could have been with the other girl that I have known nearly my entire life.  \n  \nI know that if I do end up breaking up with her, I will most likely never find a girl like her again. If I don't end up breaking up with her, and we end up going long term, I will always be kicking myself because of my curiosity about relationships I may have had. I have never had sex with anybody but her, even.  \nI have touched upon this subject lightly with her before, and have found out that she isn't okay with an open relationship and she also would never want to take a break in the relationship.  \nBased on how well our relationship is going right now, it is unlikely that we will break up any time until we go to college, and based on what she has said about wanting to continue long-distance during college, it is unlikely to break up even then.\n\nBelow is a summary of the above POST.
