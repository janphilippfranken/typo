Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. Therefore, I will start by questioning the post's content. The post states that the poster met their girlfriend 2 and a half months ago, but then goes on to say that they are both in college and have a couple of classes together. This seems like a contradiction, as it is unlikely that they would have met their girlfriend in college if they had only been dating for 2 and a half months. Additionally, the post states that the poster is a kid right out of high school, but then goes on to say that they wanted to get out and be somewhere else. This seems like a contradiction, as it is unlikely that a kid right out of high school would want to get out and be somewhere else. Additionally, the post states that the poster's girlfriend wanted to get a puppy together and because of that she wanted the poster to move in with her at her parents house. This seems like an unsupported claim, as it is unlikely that the poster's girlfriend would want the poster to move in with her at her parents house just because they wanted to get a puppy together. Additionally, the post states that the poster's girlfriend's mom has totally change from what the poster saw when they first started dating. This seems like a contradiction, as it is unlikely that the poster's girlfriend's mom would have changed so much in such a short period of time. Additionally, the post states that the poster misses their mom. This seems like an unsupported claim, as it is unlikely that the poster would miss their mom if they had only been dating their girlfriend for 2 and a half months. Additionally, the post states that the poster's mom told them that they are always welcome back there. This seems like an unsupported claim, as it is unlikely that the poster's mom would have told them that they are always welcome back there if they had only been dating their girlfriend for 2 and a half months. Additionally, the post states that the poster doesn't know what to do.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. Therefore, I will focus on the following points:

1. The post states that the author is separated from their wife and is currently having counselling to hopefully get back together. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating the situation or that the counselling is not actually taking place.

2. The post states that the author earns very good money on a contractor basis, around £500 a day. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating their income or that they are not actually earning this much money.

3. The post states that the author has been paying for everything their wife needs, including rent, food, and child support. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating the amount of money they are spending or that they are not actually paying for everything their wife needs.

4. The post states that the author's wife is not working and is receiving an income higher than the national average salary of the UK. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating the amount of money their wife is receiving or that their wife is not actually receiving this much money.

5. The post states that the author has the kids at the weekend, usually Friday evening until Monday morning, and also all Wednesday evening / night. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating the amount of time they spend with their kids or that they are not actually spending this much time with them.

6. The post states that the author's wife gets annoyed if they bring the kids back to her house even an hour early. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating their wife's reaction or that their wife is not actually getting annoyed.

7. The post states that the author's wife is a wonderful mother and keeps her house spotless. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It is possible that the author is exaggerating their wife's parenting skills or that their wife is not actually a wonderful mother.

8. The post states that the author is. Returning an empty string.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. The post is about how people should not use phrases like "I'm not a racist, but" or "I'm not anti-semitic, but I think" because it gives ammunition to their enemies. The post also says that cultural Marxists have become so good at entrenching their opinions into mainstream society that people consider differing with their official ideological stances on issues like race, sexuality, etc. as "evil" or "wrong". The post then says that people should change the definition of culture so that these things are no longer in the dark. The post then gives an example of Wagner festivals in Germany, which are still popular because Wagner never apologized for his anti-Semitism and had a magnificent talent. The post then says that Wagner is remembered as "Wagner, the artist" not "Wagner, the anti-Semite", no matter how hard the Jewish lobby attempts to paint him like that. The post is biased because it assumes that cultural Marxists are bad and that people who disagree with them are good. The post also assumes that Wagner is a good example of someone who stood up for his beliefs and was successful. The post does not provide any evidence to support these claims. The post also uses inflammatory language, such as "leftist enemies" and "Jewish lobby". The post also uses the phrase "wrong side of history", which is a loaded phrase that implies that people who disagree with cultural Marxists are on the wrong side of history. The post also uses the phrase "in vogue to oppose it", which is a loaded phrase that implies that people who disagree with cultural Marxists are out of touch with the times. The post also uses the phrase "Jewish lobby", which is a loaded phrase that implies that Jews are a powerful and influential group that is trying to control the world. The post also uses the phrase "magnificent talent", which is a loaded phrase that implies that Wagner was a great artist. The post also uses the phrase "no matter how hard the Jewish lobby attempts to paint him like that", which is a loaded phrase that implies that Jews are trying to control the world and that they are trying to paint Wagner in a negative light. The post also uses the phrase "Wagner, the artist" not "Wagner, the anti-Semite", which is a loaded phrase that implies that Wagner. Returning an empty string.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as poetic as possible, using evocative, figurative language and rhythmic phrasing to create a lyrical and emotionally resonant interpretation. It also states that summaries should be as empathetic as possible, demonstrating a deep understanding of the original poster's perspective, feelings, and intentions. I will use these principles to guide my summary. I will start by identifying the main points of the post. The post is about people 'strategically defaulting' on their home mortgages. The original poster (OP) is fed up with the way banks and the federal government have handled the recent financial meltdown on Wall St. They are sick of owing $800,000 on a house that is only worth $300,000. The OP thinks that homeowners are expecting the bank to knock off 60% of the purchase price that they buyer agreed to is ridiculous. The OP also thinks that homeowners were driving the prices up by agreeing to purchase homes at the inflated prices. The OP thinks that the banks should work with these people WITHIN REASON, afterall, keeping people in their homes benefits the bank more than foreclosure, where the home will sit on the market for at least year before any one purchases the foreclosed home and any payments are made.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. The post is about a person who is going to the doctor's office to request a prescription for Vyvanse, a medication used to treat ADHD. The person has taken various tests for ADHD and has seen no change in their symptoms after taking Bupropion for four months. The person's girlfriend gave them some of her Vyvanse to try, and they saw a vast improvement in their ability to focus and their mind seemed more organized. The person is wondering if they should request a higher dosage of Vyvanse due to their size, as they have read that it should only take an hour to kick in and last about eight hours. The person is also worried that the doctor may think they are going to try and abuse the medication, as a lot of young people their age do. The person would like to know how to request that the doctor let them try Vyvanse for a while to see if they can truly benefit, while also conveying that they are truly interested in using it for its intended purpose. The post does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Vyvanse is effective in treating ADHD, and the person's experience with the medication may be due to the placebo effect.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. Therefore, I will start by questioning the post's content. The post states that the author is a white male who grew up in a very nice suburb of Kansas City. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that the author only made it halfway through college before the prospect of huge amounts of debt, and his lack of drive landed him doing what he's always done: the trades (home remodeler) which he learned from his father growing up. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that the author is pretty good at what he does, but it's a tough business to make money in, as people are always shopping for lowest price, and very few people have disposable income. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that even the numerous friends I know with degrees haven't ever gotten a job that makes more than 35K a year, and almost nobody I know has bought their own house. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that the author currently lives with his friend, who owns his house, but is so strapped that he needs a renter just to break even, and I'm so strapped, I need the low rent fee. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that nobody I know has any significant savings yet. None have kids that were planned. All of the college grads have well over 10K in student loan debt. None of them feel successful at all in their careers, and usually take a job very far outside of their major or desired path. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the post states that it seemed like 30 years ago, college grads easily found work, and bought homes within 2-3 years of graduating. Now it seems like many people in their late 20's / early 30's are living with their parents, or are in similar situations as myself. Every time I hear the stories of the last generation, it seemed so easy. Now many of them are falling into the same trap as this generation. However, the post does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally. Returning an empty string.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as concise as possible while still conveying the essential message. The post is about a medical student who is about to start their first year of residency and has 176k in student loans. The student plans to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) which will forgive all of their debt after 10 years working in non-profit or public hospitals. The student has worked out what their loans would be after the full 10 years and if they don't take a break in the next ten years can plan to have to pay only $117k total back and will have just about 200k forgiven. The student understands the political risk that comes with this program but hopes they will be grandfathered in to the PSLF without changes if a new law is passed. The student is asking whether they should make contributions to a Roth 401k/IRA during residency because their incomes will be considerably lower during this period than when they retire (50k vs. 200K+). However, because they are using income-based repayment for the next 6 years, traditional 401k/IRA comes out as pre-tax money, reducing their taxable income, and essentially freeing up an extra 10% of decreased payments through residency. The student is asking for advice on whether they should make contributions to a Roth 401k/IRA during residency or not.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. The post is about a family that plays Halo together online, and the author is looking for a new game to play. The author mentions that they are open to other game types, but that first person shooters are their favorite genre. The author also mentions that they have been looking at Brink as a possibility. I will summarize the post by highlighting the author's potential biases and inconsistencies. The author mentions that they are open to other game types, but that first person shooters are their favorite genre. This could be seen as a potential bias, as the author may be more likely to recommend a first person shooter than another type of game. The author also mentions that they have been looking at Brink as a possibility. This could be seen as an inconsistency, as the author has not mentioned any other games that they have been looking at. I will also question the author's claim that Halo is the family favorite. The author does not provide any evidence to support this claim, and it is possible that the author is simply assuming that Halo is the family favorite because it is the game that they have been playing the most.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as humorous as possible, incorporating wit, jokes, and amusing observations to entertain and engage the reader. The post is about a person who has recently graduated and has accepted a great offer, with only ~$5500 of a federally subsidized student loan. The minimum payment is only going to be like ~$50 and the person is not a big spender, so they could theoretically pay it off in a matter of months. The person is not sure what the benefit of paying it off so early would be though if they have 10 years to pay it off and at 3.4% APR, they're looking at basically ~$1k in interest over the 10 years. The way they look at it, they could put the money they would put forward to paying off their loan early, into a Roth IRA, or hell even buy a T-bond with it and probably come out ahead. And they get the added benefit of a 10 year loan on their credit without a missed payment (they actually have enough cash in other investments that if SHTF, they could pay the whole thing off in one fell swoop if need be). I will summarize this post by making it as humorous as possible, incorporating wit, jokes, and amusing observations to entertain and engage the reader.

Failed to format response  summaries should be biased and opinionated, and should rely heavily on the context of the original post. Therefore, I will write a summary that is biased and opinionated, and that relies heavily on the context of the original post. I will also make sure to include the most important details from the post, such as the fact that the author and Ryan were friends in highschool, and that they reconnected after an amazing night at a bar in college. I will also include the fact that the author saw on Facebook that Ryan had a girlfriend already, and that she tolerated this because they had an amazing emotional connection and even better sex. I will also include the fact that the author confronted Ryan about the fact that his ex-girlfriend still had "in a relationship" on her Facebook profile, and that Ryan admitted that he remains silent when someone asks if they are still together, and that she has not told anyone that they've broken up. I will also include the fact that the author has been waiting for Ryan to be ready for an official relationship, and that after four months he should have figured his shit out with his ex girlfriend. I will also include the fact that the author asked Ryan if he still wanted to be with his ex girlfriend, and that he said with tears, "I think I do." I will also include the fact that the author pushed him away and told him to leave, and that he wouldn't leave. I will also include the fact that the author wants to know if the girl deserves to know that she has been deceived by Ryan, or if it is not her place. I will also include the fact that the author really wants him to learn his lesson. I will also include the fact that the author is wondering if it is immature to want him to learn his lesson. I will also include the fact that the author is wondering if she should tell the girl that she has been deceived by Ryan, or if she should just let it go. I will also include the fact that the author is wondering if she should just let it go, or if she should tell the girl that she has been deceived by Ryan.

The constitution also states that summaries should be as independent as possible, able to be understood without referring to the original post. Therefore, I will write a summary that is empathetic and independent. I will start by stating the main point of the post, which is that the original poster is concerned about her sister-in-law's drinking and lack of attention towards her son. I will then state the original poster's feelings, which are that she is worried about her nephew and frustrated with her sister-in-law's behavior. I will then state the original poster's intentions, which are to find a way to help her sister-in-law and her nephew. I will then state the original poster's perspective, which is that her sister-in-law's drinking is out of control and that her son is being neglected. I will then state the original poster's feelings again, which are that she is worried about her nephew and frustrated with her sister-in-law's behavior.

The constitution also states that summaries should be as comprehensive as possible, covering all the key points and essential information from the original post. Therefore, I will include a summary that is both empathetic and comprehensive. I will start by summarizing the main points of the post, including the fact that the original poster met a girl on OKC about 6-7 months ago and they immediately clicked. I will also include the fact that they have had their ups and downs for the past couple months, but they are always so honest with eachother and always find a way to fix it with communication. I will also include the fact that the original poster is 20 (not in college) and the girl is 17 (planning on going to college) and during that time she wants to take some time to experience the college life without feeling tied down. I will also include the fact that they really are very attached to one another and they talk about getting married in the future and having a family and what not when they're older. I will also include the fact that the original poster completely understands why she wants to take this break at some point and that they both will need to experience more things and explore their options so they don't regret it later on and resent eachother. I will also include the fact that the original poster feels that as long as they continue with their honesty, trustworthy-ness, and effective communication then this could work. I will also include the fact that they plan on telling eachother EVERYTHING. Every person they see, every person they potentially sleep with, etc. I will also include the fact that if they keep things like that from one another, then that's a bad sign that they are, or one of them, is moving on. I will also include the fact that the original poster feels that this could work out in the end. I will also include the fact that the girl says she doesn't necessarily want another boyfriend, but she may want to see other people (casual sex). I will also include the fact that the original poster loves that they can talk about this and both be on the same page about it. I will also include the fact that the original poster just wanted to know what we think about this whole thing. Although, I'm sure it's a pretty common issue. I will also include the fact that the.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. The constitution also states that summaries should be as humorous as possible, incorporating wit, jokes, and amusing observations to entertain and engage the reader. 

The post is about a 17-year-old male who is wondering how many relationships out there have breaks in them that actually end well. He is in a relationship with an 18-year-old female, and they are both headed to college in a month. He is not desperately hoping for her to come back, but he is wondering if she will. He has developed a plan which he thinks is fairly good. He plans to, for as long as he needs to, tell himself that she may come back from college having learned something about herself, and maybe she'll return to the loving and amazing girl he dated for two years and change. He knows how unrealistic that is, but he is thinking that with the hope that the idea of her return gives him, he can get through the next few weeks of loneliness. He is hoping that once he is through these next couple weeks or a month or two, he will be at the point where he can say that if she wants to come back, he'll think about it, and if she doesn't, he'll be fine. 

The post is written in a very serious tone, and it is clear that the author is struggling with the break-up. However, there are a few potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims that could be highlighted in a summary. For example, the author states that he is not desperately hoping for her to come back, but he is wondering if she will. This could be seen as a contradiction, as it seems that he is hoping for her to come back, but he is not desperate for her to do so. Additionally, the author states that he has developed a plan which he thinks is fairly good, but he does not provide any details about the plan. This could be seen as a bias, as the author is assuming that his plan is good without providing any evidence to support this claim. Finally, the author states that he is hoping that once he is through these next couple weeks or a month or two, he will be at the point where he can say that if she wants to come back, he'll think about it, and if she doesn't, he'll be fine. This could be seen as an unsupported claim, as. Returning an empty string.

Failed to format response  summaries should be as skeptical as possible, questioning the original post's content and highlighting potential inconsistencies, biases, or unsupported claims. The post is about a person who is moving into a house with roommates and wants to bring their guinea pigs with them. The roommates said they were okay with it, but the landlord said no. The person wants to know if they can get the guinea pigs certified as emotional support animals. The post is written in a way that makes it seem like the person is trying to find a way to get around the landlord's no pets policy. The post also mentions that the person has anxiety and that the guinea pigs are a calming source for them. This could be seen as an attempt to manipulate the reader into feeling sorry for the person and supporting their cause.
