        "0": "POST: This is my first post so please be kind :)\n\nI know that lots of people often feel confused when they come out of a long-term relationship. They think they have forgotten how to be single, or how to flirt/date.\n\nI am one of these people.\n\nThe problem is, my relationship started when I had just turned 16. I have never been single - as an adult. That might sound silly. But the only time I have ever flirted or dated was as an over-confident, hormone-riddled teenager.\n\nNow I have a pretty demanding job, responsibilities blah blah... And I just don't know how to this!\n\nI'm no way in a rush to get into a new relationship, but that doesn't mean I want to be completely alone in the mean time.\n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar, or just generally has some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",
        "1": "POST: (Full background under my submitted)\n\nI decided I couldn't wait for my ex to come around since there was no guarantee that me waiting for her would be worth it. Sure since the breakup we hadn't talked as much obviously but now that we are done seemingly forever I can't comprehend at all knowing that we will never laugh, kiss, talk etc etc together ever again. \n\nWe had so many plans and so much love but now all that is gone. How do I coupe with that? How can I move on and be happy after knowing all the hard work we put in and all the love is out the door now. I just can't wrap my head around knowing that the girl I thought I would marry will now move on and live her life away from me till the day we both die.  \n\nI still do care for her, yes I still love her even after everything that happened at the end. I feel so alone and lost even though the actual break up was months ago, I'm honestly just afraid of the future now.",
        "2": "POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day. We basically went from rather good friends to an amazing couple without any awkwardness or friendzone-y (?) problems. Because of this, we are both pretty much convinced that we have found \"the one\".\n\nHowever, I recently learned that she is rather envious of my past girlfriends, my last ex in particular. As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her. She can't quite seem to grasp the idea that with her, everything is very much different. Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this. I have consoled her the best I could, but I'd rather keep it from you redditors. This way, it might be easier to come up with an objective advice.",
        "3": "POST: On Sunday, I ran my first 10-mile race. While this is a great accomplishment I have noticed a significant spike in my sex drive during the week leading up to the race and in the days since I ran; about 10 days in total.\nI workout 2-3 times per week for about 45 minutes each time and have average eating habits. During the week leading up to the race, I ate mostly a plant-based diet - salad for lunch and dinner, fish for protein, etc. - and worked out 3 times and ran only twice (Not great prep, I know.) This helped me lose about 2 or 3 pounds.\nNow, I cannot stop thinking about sex! This morning (Thursday) I spent about 3 hours watching porn and \"distracted\" myself by going to a midday fitness class. Now I want to jerk off again or have find someone to sex.\nI don't know what to do. This is both embarrassing and confusing. I want to continue working out but am honestly afraid being fit will turn me into a sex addict.\nBackground: I played soccer in college and recall a similar correlation during my off season workouts. I am now in my late 20s and no longer train 5-6 days a week as was the norm in college. This is the most physically active I have been since my early 20s.\nQuestion: Is there research that has connected a higher sex drive (thinking more about sex) with a increased physical activity (working out)? Also, share your experiences because I feel like an outlier here.",
        "4": "POST: This is kinda non-romantic, I suppose. I recently made several new friends on twitter. All of them are girls. They're all fairly cute but I've been burned once by internet relationships and I wasn't really looking for another\n\nWell... I got drunk and told one of the girls that I thought she was really cute but that I \"didn't mean anything serious about it.\"\n\nI woke up in the morning and realized what I'd done and apologized and her exact words were \"no no, it's always nice to know somebody thinks you look nice :)\"\n\nI feel awful about it and I feel like a creep but I feel like apologizing further would just make it weirder. We haven't spoken since and I don't have many friends (even very casual ones like this one) and it just makes me feel worse that I think I accidentally fucked one up I think.\n\nI can include the exact messages exchanged if need be.",

Because of this, and several other things, I became quite depressed and our relationship suffered for it, and it eventually led to us breaking up. One of the main reasons him giving is that i was too negative and he couldn't deal with my depression as well as his stress, which I can understand.  \n\nAlthough i can see that the relationship wasn't right for me, I just cant get past that initial stage of heartbreak.  I have just been a complete mess for the past few weeks, cant sleep, cant eat, I cant do anything.  Having read all the articles about how to get over a relationship, I'm trying to follow them, but things are made difficult by the fact that a lot of my friends have moved away from my home town, there isn't much to do in the way of hobbies around here (I live in a small Welsh village), and most of the friends that I made in the past three years are mutual with my ex so it is difficult to visit and attend social events without seeing him.  I just feel really lonely.  I just dont know how to get out of this slump that I'm in.  I know people say that you have to go through the pain, but I feel unless I do something, I will never get through it.  \n\nHow have you gotten over the initial stages of heartbreak reddit?

I'm a gamer so my diet is poor and I tend to sit around a lot. I've already got my diet on the way to a greener future so that is covered but thoughts are still welcome on that. I'd like to stay away from going to the gym if possible, my ultimate goal is to be thinner and look like I'm in good shape but I don't want to build a lot of muscle, so mostly cardio work I was thinking. I thought a morning jog that would go progressively further everyday would be a start but I'm unsure as I've never tried to lose weight before, doing this in the morning to me would also rid me of my laziness by forcing me to be active first thing in the morning.

She feels more that every other aspect of her life (career, school, family, financials...) must be perfectly in place to accommodate marriage regardless of how long that takes. \n\nAfter getting back together and being more clear that I would be willing to date happily until she felt her life was in order if she was considerate of me not wanting to date just to hold off marriage. and things have been going relatively well since then (3+ years since). We have travelled together, spent family holidays together and always been in open communication about our motivations, opinions, aspirations and disagreements. We have not lived together.\n\nSince 1-2 months ago we have been slowly having more and more difficulty with our depth/frequency of conversation and it is making her very uncertain about our relationships future and how much I care for her.\nI am someone who is very easygoing, patient, I feel loved by just spending quality time (out of the house especially) together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I would only expect to have a thought provoking and deep conversation with my closest friends and family perhaps 1 time per month, and somewhat more with my SO.\nShe is someone who is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating.\n\nIt does not, to me, feel like we've been having fewer conversations but she tells me I have been less ready to participate actively and less giving of my time for such conversations. I feel that such an intense level of conversation just isn't sustainable, she feels it's necessary. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time.\n\nIs this normal?

To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area. You can get all kinds of foods there, ranging from Irish pub to mediocre Chinese food to sushi to Gelato. My personal favorite is currently the mac and cheese shop, but that's not the point.\n\nWhen I was in high school and come into Boston on my own, I would always make a bee line to the Greek shop in Faneuil Hall. During my first time there, I noticed the food item called \"tzatziki - a kind of Greek yogurt.\" Coming from East Bumfuck, NH, I didn't know much about many other cultures' food stuffs, but I certainly knew about Greek yogurt!\n\nI don't know why I choose this, because I hated yogurt at the time (\"it has live bacteria in it!\" I can't explain the logic in that argument if I tried,) but I decided to order it. The people at the counter looked at me and were like, \"Okay, tzatziki aaaaaand?\" And then I cheerfully replied with, \"Oh, and a Nantucket Nectar!\"\n\nThey just looked at me, reached into the display case, and slid the solid near-2 cup tub of tzatziki over to me. I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon. It tasted great, but after like five or more bites it caused that reaction where your body is just like, \"Okay, you need to cool it with that stuff.\"\n\nI proceeded to order tzatziki every time I went to Faneuil Hall for a solid year. I couldn't figure out why everyone around me looked at me with mild disgust/bewilderment. Until I looked at the ingredient list for an online recipe for tzatziki.",

Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. \n\nWe went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)\n\nI would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.\n\nSorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.",
        "10": "POST: So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",

I was able to calculate my BMR (By the way is there one calculator that is better than the others? I got a few different numbers.)

Most of the provided resources provide diets to try don't seem like they would lend themselves well to everyday/lifetime eating. I don't know how to eat healthy. The last time I tried to truly get in good shape I did it all wrong. I'm talking eating only 800-900 calories a day, counting obsessively, cutting out all my favorite foods, and interspersed with bouts of binging on aforementioned foods.

I thought to myself, \"Why don't I just blow my nose in the shower, I mean, it's all just going to go down the drain anyway?\" \n\nSo I let it rip. Huge chunks of mucus came flying out my nose and onto the bottom of the tub. They were actually so big that I had to intentionally get water to flow onto them to make them move. I got out of the shower, feeling MUCH better with myself, and put my clothes on. As I was downstairs getting the last of my stuff together, I could hear my roommate getting up and walking into the bathroom. I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm.

It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.",

Mike tells me that nobody's seen or heard from Joey in years and messaged him through a fake Facebook account and Joey is moving across the country to get away from parents, but in doing this he is moving in with Mike. \n\nSo I'm shocked at dinner and the rest of the drive as Mike also talks about the huge probability of them being together.

We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?",

He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it.

I understand that I can meet more people who are into a similar lifestyle as mine (thank god my girlfriend is an active person), but I've known these guys for so long, I just wish I could motivate them into losing weight and being active - they have no idea what kind of life they're missing.",
        "49": "POST: My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness. We have had real problems with him pulling on the lead, and the Mekuti harness has worked wonders, but didn't eliminate the problem. He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it. If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt. If I'd known these relatives were going to put one on him, I wouldn't have let them look after him. Still, it works and doesn't hurt him, my only worry is it'll do psychological damage somehow.",

Of course I don't show her any of this, but this is a fucking awful and paralyzing feeling I would like to stop having. I'm used to being pretty independent and having enough stuff in my life going on that I normally wouldn't be like that.

Things progressed fairly quickly; after a month she told me she loved me and began referring to herself as my girlfriend- this signaled to me that we were an \"official\" relationship. \n\nAnyways we both come from different states, and would be long-distance during our summer break- we'd both be back at school in mid-august. Before we left, she told me she didn't want to be in a long-distance relationship and that she didn't know if she would want to remain exclusive over the summer break. I saw this as essentially the end of our relationship and I told her that I would be moving on. \n\nThis is where things got complicated, as what I said seemed to really upset her. She asked why we couldn't \"just be friends and talk\" over summer then get back together in the fall, and I ignored her for a few days before I ended up breaking down and resuming contact with her. We are still talking and she has at times mentioned plans of what we'll do together when we come back to school, but I just don't know.\n\nWe aren't in an \"official\" relationship, but I feel as if I'm being used; she wants to be single over the summer, but wants me to hang around so we can get back together in the fall. I think this is unfair and I don't like the idea of us going from a relationship to being friends to back to a relationship whenever she wants. \n\nI do have very strong feelings for her, but I don't like the idea that she wants to be single while we're apart but then get back together if nobody better comes along.",

However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  \n\nSimilar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.

We would hang out together, kiss and stuff, and then nothing again.\n\nWell, last week I get a message, that she is getting married with that \"friend\" (few days before that, she told me that she still likes me, and kissed a bunch).

Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group.

I work in HR and have 3 roommates and rarely get a moment to breath. So I recently got a chance to take a lengthy vacation, and I want to use it to take a cross-country road trip I've wanted for a long time. My plan is for it to take around 3 months, I'll be stopping at several national parks, big cities, and visiting my brother. \nThe issue here is that I told my best friend about it and she has assumed that I want her to come as well, since she's recently graduated and this would be a good time for her. While I love my best friend, this is defeating the purpose of the trip. Best friend is extremely extroverted, does not understand the concept of wanting to do something alone. She's also rather princessy, and would likely complain about a lot of the hikes/nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, and enjoy some peace and quiet for once in my life. I know that 3-months in each other's faces would probably cause a fight, and that's the last thing I want to deal with on this trip. Is there a way I can tell her this is something I want to do alone, or should I just bring her and hope for the best? Would I regret going alone and halfway through, wish I had some company?",

We had made an agreement to compromise that if I waited for her for 2 years to finish the master she would come back with me to America.\n\nAfter her coming to visit my family, my parents told me that the feeling they received from her is that she wouldn't come to America after school, and would make excuses to try and keep me in Europe.\n\nI currently am working at a dead end job in Europe and know that I can come back to America and make much more money and be much happier with my life, but it feel so guilty about leaving her since I made a promise that I wouldn't give her up for a job.\n\nWe recently had a big fight and it put a big strain on our relationship, but she apologized and things have been getting to how they were. I'm just confused. My parents and friends tell me I should just do what's right for me, go for the job that I really want.\n\nI still love her, and I know she really loves me.. I just feel leaving her would devastate \n\nWhat should I do?",

My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.\n\nThe problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. \n\nI cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.\n\nI remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.\n\nSo, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.\n\nIt's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.",

The house is in a quiet town, kind of suburb-ish. The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since. She has a collar on but no phone# tag. \n I now have this looming feeling that she ran away because of Caesar. I hate that I'll never know for sure and he'll be moving with me in a few days.",

Excited with the idea, she agreed.\n\nAt the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.

Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day.

        "119": "POST: My friend picked up a dog two days ago from a shelter, an eleven month old female husky/shepherd (possibly German Shepherd?) mix. She is super sweet most of the time, but she growled at my friend's mother, and at my friend when she was going to pick up a stick, then the dog nipped at one of her friends because the girl tried to push the dog down. The bite ended up drawing blood, and since it was so soon after getting the dog (and apparently the shelter released the dog without her rabies shot), my friend called the shelter to see what to do. They told her she had to quarantine the dog for 10 days, which she had to do at the shelter. When she took the dog in, she described the behavior above and the woman at the shelter strongly recommended turning the dog over to be euthanized because she was too \"unpredictable\" and could be dangerous. My friend felt she didn't have much choice in the matter and turned the dog over. I'm not sure if she can even get her back now (she's in the quarantine process at the moment), but my question is whether there is training that is likely to help this kind of behavior? She showed no aggression towards me whatsoever, but my friend is worried she'll be too dangerous to take out in public or to have people come over. She wants a dog she'd be able to take out with her to public places, but she's also been crying all day about the dog being put down. I'd really like to believe she could train the dog to be better, but is random aggression something that can be gotten rid of? If the responses are unpredictable, what can you really do?",

I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. \n\nThe next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all.

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?",

I am house-sitting for them while they are on vacation and taking care of their parrots. Let me explain why this infestation is so weird.\n\nMy parents have 2 dogs that are on the best flea medication that they can get and the dogs 100% do NOT have fleas, the fleas are localized only to the basement, where the dogs don't go (in fact, the dogs aren't even here right now). The fleas are in the basement, where my parents keep 4 eclectus parrots and 2 cockatoos that I am watching while they are away. \n\nThe basement is unfinished-- there is NO carpet down there, but there is an old sofa located near the birds' cages, but we have flea-bombed the basement twice before my parents left for vacation and the fleas have not been killed. What is unusual is that fleas don't usually (and aren't as far as I know) feed on parrots, so the parrots are not serving as a host for them. \n\nI am going directly from my parents' place to my girlfriend's when they return from their trip, and she has a cat that is not on any flea medication. I am trying to make absolutely sure that her cat does not get fleas from me. I have absolutely no idea how the fleas are still alive downstairs, but I want to try and kill them off. Flea-bombing is dangerous to the birds and we have to take them all out of the basement for several hours when we do it, and I can't do that alone, so I am trying to find a way to kill the fleas that is not harmful to the birds and doesn't require me to move them from the basement (because I can't).",

I love my family. I don't want them to feel like I'm judging them. My sister is gorgeous. My parents are wonderful, beautiful people. I would like to have their support, but I don't think I can ask for it. My father, especially, wouldn't give up junk food if I asked them to do it with me...and asking them to do it with me feels like an even bigger slap in the face.

I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year.

She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?\n     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch?

I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her.

We started dating seriously about a month ago and he refers to me as his girlfriend.  \n\nWithin the past two days we've realized we are different.  He's conservative with traditional values and I'm more liberal and unconventional.  It's almost a good thing because he's grounding me a little more and I'm opening up his mind to different ways of thinking.  However, I've realized that he's a bit self absorbed.  Not in a narcissistic way but he only seems to be able to relate things through himself.

Bodies are natural systems, respect yours, it can only change so much so fast. The changes some people here are making are so all encompassing that encountering these problems means you deserve a pat on the back because they represent just how far you've come. Plateau after losing 100lbs? It makes me think \"oh, you're frustrated? And are you virtually unrecognizable from who you were last year? Are you able to fucking enter a gym without feeling awkward? Let alone exercise without feeling like death?\".

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us \"We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there.\" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer \"You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!\" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: \"You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.\" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. \n\nSo reddit?

I know it's crap and I've tried to before, but I just get a strong feeling of dread and I just can't do it.\n\nI know my friends love me and I hang out with someone maybe once, twice a week but it's never in a group and I'm always jealous of people that can have groups of people together like that and hanging out and stuff. \n\nI guess I just want to find stuff that will improve my self esteem, and maybe help me figure out what to do with my bf.",

They are narrow-minded straight ticket Republican voters, none of them have ever gone to college, and they all love modern pop country music; not that I mind, I just think that says a lot about a person.\n\nNow, I could deal with those differences if they stopped there. The deeper issues are grounded in their ignorance of my intrinsic personality and their obstinacy towards simply trying to understand. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features in high school and then Bipolar 1 later on. On many days, all I can do is lie in the dark and list reasons to continue living.\n\nThis frequent inability to do anything is viewed as lazy by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. However, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.\n\nI have stayed with friends on multiple occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.\n\nI really just want to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented on. How do I get out of this mindset and become the person I want to be?",

Then today, a friend of a Bob came by and said that Bob sold it to someone else, Jim. Bob never transferred thr title over to himself when he bought the car. Instead, he sold it to Jim. Jim tried to go get tags in his name, but can't because the title is still under my name. Bob and friend gave Jim my number and said that they aren't going to deal with the situation and Bob changed his number.Now Jim wants me to go with him to the DMV and sign the title over to him. That isn't legal, I think. Because I sold the car to Bob, and I already turned in the bill of sale/notice of transfer to the tax collector So isn't this out of my control and Bob's problem?

Not to mention the fact that I'd never really experienced being so gratuitously complimented by a member of the opposite sex. We've been dating for nearly a year and she hasn't slowed down in telling me how \"hot\" and \"perfect\" I am, and how she can't find a single flaw with me (these are her words mind you; I'm a pretty humble guy, probably a hard 7 in terms of looks, and am not perfect by any means). The more I hear it, the more cringe-worthy it becomes. The worst part is that she uses it as a metric for her own self-deprecation, saying how she needs to \"work out twice a day just to be hot enough for me\" when I persistently tell her that I am perfectly happy with the way she looks. She confesses her adulation for me on a daily basis pretty much, saying things like \"I worship pretty much everything about you\" and \"I don't know what I'd do if you left me.\" I love pretty much everything else about her, but this one tiny problem is quite maddening and I feel like I'm becoming less attracted to her the more she says these things.

When he came up to me, he started with the usual sleaze about how we must be cousins because we both drive BMWs.

Oh, and there was a $2 tax on the damn thing so it actually came out to $12.\n\nHe ran my card, handed me a receipt, and the transaction was over. I'm sure he felt good about having basically hustled me into walking over there under the impression that I'd get a free can and then actually making a sale.

Now you can actually keep your word,\" and got back in my car and drove off.\n\nIt felt good doing this and I'd love to hear some stories of similar things that you may have done to help others at your cost, perhaps to prove a point or just to flat out pay it forward.",

Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one.

If any one can list a bit ''less tourist-y'' locations or less known yet still interesting it would be also great. \nI don't speak German well, is it possible to communicate with locals in English? Girlfriend does speak German but I'd like to participate in talking. And what are prices in general there?",

Mandarin is a whole new language to me.\n\nNow I replied to her in english, explaining that I have no idea what she needs. At which point she she starts to cry even harder and louder and wraps her arms around her head... I was thinking wtf...

No more cooking with garlic or onion (which is devastating for me, because I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THE SHIT OUT OF THOSE INGREDIENTS).

This wouldn't really be that bad, considering when we first started dating we only saw each other for a short time during the week; we mostly communicated through an instant messenger. However, I think that the distance and different circumstances have highlighted a glaring fact- we really don't have all that much in common. When we were in highschool, we could hide this by talking about classes and the like, but now that we don't have any classes, teachers, or experiences in common, our chatting has dried to just about nil.\n\nI am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing.

We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together.

An exclamation point takes no extra time to type in an e-mail and if a student comes to you during their own free time to show you something they thought was interesting and relevant, chances are they have taken a liking to you.

I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.

I work part time a fast food place, usually at the back preparing food while she works at the front serving customers. Because of this there is literally no chance or time for us to talk. However a few people left from the front so I trained up there with her today for 2 hours. \n\nIt went fine, we laughed and chatted, got to know each other a bit and we were both smiling a lot. However I'm not sure if I'm working at the front after this so that might have been my only chance to talk to her - ever. I've wanted to get to know her ever since she started, she has such a cute smile is has always been friendly whenever our paths have crossed but now I don't know what to do. I learned today that she's a year older than me (she's 17) and going to uni next year. I can't stop thinking about her and I don't know what to do. She was so nice to me but I might never see her again plus if she's older than me is that weird? I mean where do I go from here? She's clever, we have a similar personality and I really really like her, a lot but I don't know how she feels about me. I've only spoke to her for 2 hours just... what do I do?\n\nSorry if this was kind of a vent I just really need some advice, what the hell do I do? I think I'm fucking in love with her.

        "240": "POST: All right. So this has a little backstory. The \"friend\" is someone I have been trying to date for the past month and a 1/2. She said yes to go out with me, but when I invite her out on a date, she says she wants to get to know me better before we jump in to anything.\n\nOk. I get that. We just start hanging out here and there. Get to know each other. I learn that she's had issues with her weight. It's a big problem for her. Not a problem for me. Fast forward to last Saturday (3/26), and she tells me that she's failing school and wants to focus on herself right now and isn't looking for a relationship. I was pretty broken up because it came out of nowhere and I thought things were going great.\n\nI've still talked to her these past few days like nothing happened. Nothing relationship related, though. Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, \"Bae\" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways.\n\nLast night, she sent me a snap that just said, \"Wow.\" Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.\n\nI asked a few of my friends about their opinion on the situation and they said she's just trying to control me. I just have no idea what I should do. Hell, I'm still confused and not sure how I really think about it.",

I want to know if this is as messed up as I think it is, or if I'm overreacting. \n\nMy girlfriend uses birth control, so we have sex without condoms, but as an extra precaution when I come, I pull out and come on her. The last time we had sex, right after I came, she commented about how much nicer it was that it all sort of pooled into one place (I pull her close to me and it has nowhere to go), unlike her ex, who I guess splattered all over her. \n\nI fully understand that I'm not the only guy she's had sex with. I may even have been open to talking about it in some other context. But to me, when I literally just pulled out and came on you, the last thing I want to hear is anything about your ex, and especially nothing comparing sex with me to sex with him. It threw me off my game for a minute and I got cold/distant. She complained that my reaction hurt her feelings and I could tell she wanted me to apologize or something. It was very late and I was tired, so I did. \n\nThe more I think about it, though, the more it bothers me. I feel like I was right. She's going to think whatever she's going to think, but to vocalize about sex and ex in the same sentence when I was just inside you seems like the height of rudeness. \n\nAm I wrong to feel this way?

I don't like clubbing myself and I know my bf doesn't dance but I thought it was his social activity. \n\nWell last month they were going clubbing as they normally do and I decided to tag along. The things I saw them do was terrifying. Some of these guys have girlfriends!. These are guys in their 30's and they were dry humping young girls who looked not much older than 16, Im guessing teenagers who just turned 18 were having too much alcohol to hold down. If the security guard didn't interfere I'm pretty sure 3 of the guys would end up having sex with the same girl on the dance floor or who knows they might of all joined in. \n\nThis wasn't a boys night out their main and only aim was trying to hook up with randoms, but it wasn't one on one type hook up. 2 or 3 of them would be making out with the same girl the other 2 would be humping really aggressively against another drunk young girl, I'm guessing they were trying to get some \"group activity\" going. \n\nI couldn't believe this was what they f*ing called \"boys night out\". Bf said \"yeah they get a little out of hand sometimes but they're not hurting anyone, its all consensual\" \n\nI started wondering what it is my bf does when I'm not around since he doesn't dance and his buddies are all busy trying to hookup with the same person. Does he just sit quietly in the corner and drink or does he join them ? \n\nHe has cheated on me before, he kissed a girl at one of his friends birthday party and I only found out through a mutual friend. We took a break and tried to rebuild trust and its been good. But now he wants to go clubbing this weekend with the \"boys\" again. \n\nI don't want him to go. Am I being controlling ?

Throughout our relationship I have been a dumbass and flirted with girls, even sent some pics that I shouldn't have.  This has happen not just once but about three times.  However, in the last year I wanted to get my shit together because she is a pretty kick ass girl.\n\nI don't know why I sent naked pics and flirted like I did while in a relationship.  It just something I got a thrill from doing (and in the end, help me get off).  I would feel guilty about it afterwards though.  \n\nMy partner's father cheated on her mother and hurt her pretty good by it.  So I understand her trusting issues and I haven't done anything to help it with what I've done.  It is too the point where she monitors me closely everyday.

Once again, I understand why.\n\nMy biggest problem is because I have done these things in the past, I feel like I've doomed this relationship.  How can I ever feel like the perfect guy for her when I've screwed up so many times.  I can't pretend that I the knight in shinning armor.  Because of all this, I feel like this relationship is at a standstill and we are just together cause its comfortable.

That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started going on casual dates and meeting new people. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life. A few weeks ago, I met this guy at a party, and we started flirting, nothing crazy, kissed, then I left. I thought it was a one-off thing, but we ended up going on a few dates before break and talk a lot now. \n\nHe's made it very clear that he wants a relationship.

I live in North Philadelphia, not the nicest place, so I don't hang around the fence but every day as I pass, the dog is laying either on the pavement (Next to about 10 piles of it's droppings) or in this wooden shack looking dog house. Today the dog was sitting right along the fence. It's face was just droopy and miserable, it's eyes were blood red, and it seemed to have an abrasion/patch of fur missing on it's side/front leg. The last time I was this close to the dog, it barked at me. Today, it just stared blankly. I've been wondering what I can/should do all semester. Is there someone I can/should call? Should I mind my own business?

With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again.

Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has.

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.\n\nSummary: So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units.

Their dad picked them up to go to the ER, and during the hour and a half they were gone, someone robbed their house. The author found clothing on their porch and their dog feasting on a plastic bag. When they got to their room, they saw that their monitor was crooked and the cables were off, and their consoles were gone. The author was baffled and in shock, realizing that someone had robbed their house. This is a satirical summary that uses irony and exaggeration to expose the absurdity of the situation.

This can be especially true for those who enjoy meeting new people and learning about their lives, as the original poster seems to be. However, it's important to recognize that this desire for novelty can also be a sign of a deeper issue, such as a fear of commitment or a lack of emotional connection with one's partner.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, it's important to first identify the root cause of the desire for novelty. Is it a fear of commitment, a lack of emotional connection, or something else? Once the root cause is identified, it's important to work on addressing it. This may involve seeking therapy or counseling, or simply having open and honest conversations with one's partner about one's feelings and needs.\n\nIt's also important to remember that relationships require effort and commitment from both partners. It's not enough to simply find \"the one\" or to be in \"true love\" - relationships require work and dedication to maintain. This means being willing to compromise, communicate openly and honestly, and make an effort to keep the relationship exciting and fulfilling.\n\nIn conclusion, the desire for novelty in relationships is a common challenge, but it can be overcome with effort and commitment.

She gets upset when he is unavailable and feels down when he doesn't respond to her texts. The OP recognizes that this behavior is unhealthy and does not want to depend on her boyfriend in this way. She is seeking advice on how to break this habit.\n\nAnalysis: The OP's post demonstrates a lack of emotional regulation and an unhealthy attachment style. Her obsession with her boyfriend and her negative reactions to his unavailability suggest that she may have an anxious attachment style, which is characterized by a fear of abandonment and a need for constant reassurance from her partner. This can lead to clingy behavior and a sense of dependency on the relationship.\n\nTo break this habit, the OP could try implementing some strategies to improve her emotional regulation and develop a more secure attachment style. Some suggestions include:\n\n1. Practicing mindfulness and self-care: Engaging in activities that promote relaxation and self-reflection can help the OP regulate her emotions and reduce her anxiety. This could include meditation, yoga, or journaling.\n\n2. Setting boundaries: The OP could establish clear boundaries with her boyfriend, such as setting aside specific times for communication and limiting the amount of time they spend together. This can help her feel more independent and reduce her reliance on the relationship.\n\n3. Seeking support: The OP could talk to a therapist or counselor who can help her explore her attachment style and develop healthier coping mechanisms. She could also seek support from friends or family members who can provide a listening ear and offer advice.\n\n4. Focusing on personal growth: The OP could focus on her own personal growth and development, such as pursuing hobbies or interests that bring her joy and fulfillment. This can help her feel more confident and independent, reducing her need for constant validation from her boyfriend.\n\nOverall, breaking this habit will require effort and commitment from the OP, but with the right strategies and support, she can develop a healthier and more secure attachment style in her relationship.",

When they met in person, the woman felt comfortable and at ease, but did not experience the intense, nervous, immediate infatuation that she had experienced in previous relationships. They had sex, and the man remarked on how \"good different\" everything was. The woman is confused because she had purposely searched for men who were not her type, and she had a string of tumultuous relationships with men who idolized her and then crashed and burned.

        "123": "The original poster (OP) is a 20-year-old woman who lives with her boyfriend of the same age. They were previously in a long-distance relationship until May of this year. The OP is concerned because her boyfriend has never posted anything about their relationship on social media, including pictures, statuses, or even tagging her in posts. She also had to initiate making their relationship Facebook official after waiting several months for him to do so. The OP is unsure whether she is being ridiculous or if she should be concerned about her boyfriend's lack of social media presence regarding their relationship. She is seeking advice on how to bring up the issue with her boyfriend without sounding stupid.\n\nAnalysis: The OP's concern about her boyfriend's lack of social media presence regarding their relationship is valid. Social media has become an important part of modern relationships, and many couples use it to share their experiences and express their love for each other. The fact that the OP's boyfriend has not posted anything about their relationship on social media could be a sign that he is not as invested in the relationship as she is. Additionally, the fact that the OP had to initiate making their relationship Facebook official could also be a red flag. It is important for both partners in a relationship to feel comfortable and secure in their commitment to each other, and the OP's boyfriend's reluctance to make their relationship public could be a sign that he is not fully committed.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the OP's boyfriend simply does not use social media as much as she does, or that he prefers to keep his personal life private. It is important for the OP to communicate with her boyfriend about her concerns and to try to understand his perspective. She could start by asking him why he has not posted anything about their relationship on social media, and whether he feels comfortable making their relationship public. If he is not comfortable with it, she could try to understand his reasons and see if there is a compromise that they can both agree on.\n\nIn terms of how to bring up the issue with her boyfriend without sounding stupid, the OP could try to approach the conversation in a non-confrontational way. She could start by expressing her own feelings and concerns, and then ask her boyfriend how he feels about their relationship and whether he has any concerns of his own. It is important for both partners to feel heard and understood in a relationship, and by approaching the conversation in a respectful and open-minded way, the OP can create a safe space for her boyfriend to share",

By communicating openly and honestly with his girlfriend and focusing on the positive aspects of their relationship, the OP can work towards overcoming his jealousy and insecurity and building a strong and healthy relationship.",

        "184": "The post above raises important questions about the nature of addiction and the role of honesty in recovery. It is clear that the author has personal experience with self-harm and is trying to help their friend overcome their addiction. However, the author's friend is not being honest about their self-harm, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the author's approach. It is possible that the author's friend is not ready to stop self-harming and that the author's efforts to help are only making the situation worse. It is also possible that the author's friend is not being honest because they are ashamed of their addiction and do not want to disappoint the author. In either case, it is clear that the author's approach is not working and that a new approach is needed. The author must find a way to help their friend without forcing them to be honest, which may require a more compassionate and understanding approach. Ultimately, the author's friend must be willing to be honest about their addiction in order to overcome it, but the author must also be willing to accept their friend's honesty, even if it is difficult to hear.",

And then you go on about your day, LIKE THE GODDAMN WEIGHT LOSS HERO THAT YOU ARE. \n\nTo track my weight loss over the last 4 months I made a graph in a spreadsheet program. It's not a straight line down, it's actually peaks and valleys. The *general* trend is down (28lbs today - holla!) but what I've noticed is that every time the \"whoosh fairy\" visits me and gives me a nice chunk of weight loss, she takes back some of it over the next week. Then she gives me just a *bit* more - enough to keep the graph going down. Thank you, Whoosh Fairy.

The post suggests that the narrator's girlfriend may have lost interest in him or may be cheating on him, but it also leaves open the possibility that there may be something that can be done to fix the situation.

However, it is important to remember that relationships are not static, and people change and grow over time. It is possible that his girlfriend is simply going through a phase, and that things will return to normal once they are able to spend more time together. It is also possible that she is not as committed to the relationship as he is, and that she is exploring other options. In either case, it is important for the OP to communicate his feelings and concerns to his girlfriend, and to be open to hearing her perspective. It is also important for him to trust his girlfriend and to give her the benefit of the doubt, unless he has concrete evidence to the contrary. Finally, it is important for the OP to focus on his own happiness and well-being, and to remember that he is not responsible for his girlfriend's actions or feelings.",

Unfortunately, she lives about 3 hours inland from me, which requires a decent amount of planning to hang out.  She has expressed interest in hanging out, but whenever I bring up plans she gets iffy.  Just the other night though I laid everything out that we could do one afternoon x, x, and x and that we would have a lot of fun.  Also that I am not coming to hook up with her.\n\nShe just kept saying that she feels weird about meeting me as opposed to other guys closer by (who she admittedly has not had a great track record with).  Mentioned that she feels dirty meeting all these guys (she has had 8 other dates, but hasn't really skyped or befriended them as much as she has me) -- like a whore.  I asked her if she wasn't comfortable with me (which is ok) but she said I was fine and that she just feels like she isn't as fun of a person to hang out with in person. \n\nAfter insisting that we would have fun and that I can go home any time, she changed her mind and said we could give it a try. So we set up a day and I was going to call her the day before just to make sure she was still completely ok.  I don't know what gives though or what to say when she gets pessimistic about that.  She specifically said \"I want to hang out with you but I just don't know\"  Maybe she is nervous about what would happen?",

The boyfriend is allergic to garlic and onion, which is a common food allergy, but the author seems to be exaggerating the severity of the allergy. She claims that her boyfriend gets sick even from cooked garlic and onion, which is highly unlikely. The author also describes a recent episode where her boyfriend had severe abdominal pain and was shivering and having full body spasms, which is clearly an exaggeration.\n\nThe author then goes on to describe how she has put her foot down and is no longer cooking with garlic or onion, which is a drastic and unnecessary measure. The author claims that it is almost impossible to avoid garlic and onion at restaurants, which is also an exaggeration. The author then describes how her boyfriend is pushing for them to just go ahead and eat garlic and onion, which is clearly a bad idea given his severe allergy.\n\nThe author then asks for ideas about how to support her boyfriend so he doesn't feel like he's letting her down or repressed and stuck eating bland food. This is a ridiculous request, as the author is the one who is causing the problem by exaggerating the severity of her boyfriend's allergy and putting unnecessary restrictions on their diet.\n\nThe author then goes on to describe how trying out restaurants was one of their favorite things to do together, but now they have to go back home after the bar and cook sanitized meals that neither of them are thrilled about. This is another example of the author exaggerating the severity of the situation and making it seem like her boyfriend's allergy is ruining their relationship.\n\nThe author then claims that she doesn't want to struggle with her boyfriend because he gets frustrated with the impacts this is having on their lifestyle, but this is clearly not the case.

The OP feels like they are not a priority in their boyfriend's life and wants to talk to him about it one last time to see if there is any hope of feeling better. The OP is looking for advice on how to get through to their boyfriend without causing a major fight.\n\nAnalysis: The OP's main issue seems to be a lack of communication and a feeling of being taken for granted in their relationship. They have expressed their desire to do things together and have asked their boyfriend to help them move, but their requests have been ignored or brushed off. This has led to feelings of disappointment and frustration, as well as a sense of not being a priority in their boyfriend's life.\n\nThe OP's frustration is understandable, as it is important for both partners in a relationship to feel valued and supported. It is also important for couples to spend time together and engage in activities that they both enjoy. The OP's boyfriend's behavior suggests a lack of effort and consideration on his part, which can be hurtful and damaging to the relationship.\n\nIt is important for the OP to communicate their feelings and concerns to their boyfriend in a calm and respectful manner. They should try to avoid blaming or attacking their boyfriend, as this can lead to defensiveness and further conflict. Instead, they should focus on expressing their own feelings and needs, and try to understand their boyfriend's perspective as well.\n\nIt may also be helpful for the OP to suggest specific activities or outings that they would like to do together, and to try to find a compromise that works for both of them. It is important for both partners to be willing to make an effort and to be open to trying new things.\n\nIn conclusion, the OP's feelings of disappointment and frustration are valid, and it is important for them to communicate their needs and concerns to their boyfriend in a respectful and constructive manner. By working together and making an effort to spend time together and engage in activities that they both enjoy, the OP and their boyfriend may be able to improve their relationship and feel more connected and supported.",

In the middle of the night, she woke up to find herself in between two male friends, one of whom was touching her in private places. The poster felt uncomfortable and panicked, and pretended to be asleep for about an hour. She did not confront the friend about it the next morning and has not told her partner. She is confused and stressed by what happened and is seeking advice on what to do.\n\nAnalysis: The original post raises several important issues related to consent, boundaries, and communication. The fact that the poster was touched in private places without her consent is a clear violation of her boundaries and is a form of sexual assault. The fact that she pretended to be asleep and did not confront the friend about it suggests that she may have felt powerless or afraid to speak up. This is a common reaction to sexual assault, and it is important to recognize that it is not the victim's fault.\n\nThe fact that the poster has not told her partner about what happened is also concerning. It is important for partners to be able to trust and communicate with each other, and keeping something like this a secret can erode that trust. It is also important for the poster to seek support and help from her partner, as well as from other trusted friends or professionals.\n\nThe fact that the poster is worried about causing a rift in her friend group is also a valid concern. However, it is important to prioritize her own safety and well-being over the comfort of others. It may be necessary to have a difficult conversation with the friend who touched her, as well as with the rest of the group, in order to establish clear boundaries and ensure that this type of behavior does not happen again.\n\nIn conclusion, the original post raises important issues related to consent, boundaries, and communication. It is important for the poster to seek support and help from her partner and other trusted friends or professionals, and to prioritize her own safety and well-being over the comfort of others.
