        "0": "POST: This is my first post so please be kind :)\n\nI know that lots of people often feel confused when they come out of a long-term relationship. They think they have forgotten how to be single, or how to flirt/date.\n\nI am one of these people.\n\nThe problem is, my relationship started when I had just turned 16. I have never been single - as an adult. That might sound silly. But the only time I have ever flirted or dated was as an over-confident, hormone-riddled teenager.\n\nNow I have a pretty demanding job, responsibilities blah blah... And I just don't know how to this!\n\nI'm no way in a rush to get into a new relationship, but that doesn't mean I want to be completely alone in the mean time.\n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar, or just generally has some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",
        "1": "POST: (Full background under my submitted)\n\nI decided I couldn't wait for my ex to come around since there was no guarantee that me waiting for her would be worth it. Sure since the breakup we hadn't talked as much obviously but now that we are done seemingly forever I can't comprehend at all knowing that we will never laugh, kiss, talk etc etc together ever again. \n\nWe had so many plans and so much love but now all that is gone. How do I coupe with that? How can I move on and be happy after knowing all the hard work we put in and all the love is out the door now. I just can't wrap my head around knowing that the girl I thought I would marry will now move on and live her life away from me till the day we both die.  \n\nI still do care for her, yes I still love her even after everything that happened at the end. I feel so alone and lost even though the actual break up was months ago, I'm honestly just afraid of the future now.",
        "2": "POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day. We basically went from rather good friends to an amazing couple without any awkwardness or friendzone-y (?) problems. Because of this, we are both pretty much convinced that we have found \"the one\".\n\nHowever, I recently learned that she is rather envious of my past girlfriends, my last ex in particular. As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her. She can't quite seem to grasp the idea that with her, everything is very much different. Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this. I have consoled her the best I could, but I'd rather keep it from you redditors. This way, it might be easier to come up with an objective advice.",
        "3": "POST: On Sunday, I ran my first 10-mile race. While this is a great accomplishment I have noticed a significant spike in my sex drive during the week leading up to the race and in the days since I ran; about 10 days in total.\nI workout 2-3 times per week for about 45 minutes each time and have average eating habits. During the week leading up to the race, I ate mostly a plant-based diet - salad for lunch and dinner, fish for protein, etc. - and worked out 3 times and ran only twice (Not great prep, I know.) This helped me lose about 2 or 3 pounds.\nNow, I cannot stop thinking about sex! This morning (Thursday) I spent about 3 hours watching porn and \"distracted\" myself by going to a midday fitness class. Now I want to jerk off again or have find someone to sex.\nI don't know what to do. This is both embarrassing and confusing. I want to continue working out but am honestly afraid being fit will turn me into a sex addict.\nBackground: I played soccer in college and recall a similar correlation during my off season workouts. I am now in my late 20s and no longer train 5-6 days a week as was the norm in college. This is the most physically active I have been since my early 20s.\nQuestion: Is there research that has connected a higher sex drive (thinking more about sex) with a increased physical activity (working out)? Also, share your experiences because I feel like an outlier here.",
        "4": "POST: This is kinda non-romantic, I suppose. I recently made several new friends on twitter. All of them are girls. They're all fairly cute but I've been burned once by internet relationships and I wasn't really looking for another\n\nWell... I got drunk and told one of the girls that I thought she was really cute but that I \"didn't mean anything serious about it.\"\n\nI woke up in the morning and realized what I'd done and apologized and her exact words were \"no no, it's always nice to know somebody thinks you look nice :)\"\n\nI feel awful about it and I feel like a creep but I feel like apologizing further would just make it weirder. We haven't spoken since and I don't have many friends (even very casual ones like this one) and it just makes me feel worse that I think I accidentally fucked one up I think.\n\nI can include the exact messages exchanged if need be.",

Because of this, and several other things, I became quite depressed and our relationship suffered for it, and it eventually led to us breaking up. One of the main reasons him giving is that i was too negative and he couldn't deal with my depression as well as his stress, which I can understand.  \n\nAlthough i can see that the relationship wasn't right for me, I just cant get past that initial stage of heartbreak.  I have just been a complete mess for the past few weeks, cant sleep, cant eat, I cant do anything.  Having read all the articles about how to get over a relationship, I'm trying to follow them, but things are made difficult by the fact that a lot of my friends have moved away from my home town, there isn't much to do in the way of hobbies around here (I live in a small Welsh village), and most of the friends that I made in the past three years are mutual with my ex so it is difficult to visit and attend social events without seeing him.  I just feel really lonely.  I just dont know how to get out of this slump that I'm in.  I know people say that you have to go through the pain, but I feel unless I do something, I will never get through it.  \n\nHow have you gotten over the initial stages of heartbreak reddit?

I'm a gamer so my diet is poor and I tend to sit around a lot. I've already got my diet on the way to a greener future so that is covered but thoughts are still welcome on that. I'd like to stay away from going to the gym if possible, my ultimate goal is to be thinner and look like I'm in good shape but I don't want to build a lot of muscle, so mostly cardio work I was thinking. I thought a morning jog that would go progressively further everyday would be a start but I'm unsure as I've never tried to lose weight before, doing this in the morning to me would also rid me of my laziness by forcing me to be active first thing in the morning.

She feels more that every other aspect of her life (career, school, family, financials...) must be perfectly in place to accommodate marriage regardless of how long that takes. \n\nAfter getting back together and being more clear that I would be willing to date happily until she felt her life was in order if she was considerate of me not wanting to date just to hold off marriage. and things have been going relatively well since then (3+ years since). We have travelled together, spent family holidays together and always been in open communication about our motivations, opinions, aspirations and disagreements. We have not lived together.\n\nSince 1-2 months ago we have been slowly having more and more difficulty with our depth/frequency of conversation and it is making her very uncertain about our relationships future and how much I care for her.\nI am someone who is very easygoing, patient, I feel loved by just spending quality time (out of the house especially) together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I would only expect to have a thought provoking and deep conversation with my closest friends and family perhaps 1 time per month, and somewhat more with my SO.\nShe is someone who is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating.\n\nIt does not, to me, feel like we've been having fewer conversations but she tells me I have been less ready to participate actively and less giving of my time for such conversations. I feel that such an intense level of conversation just isn't sustainable, she feels it's necessary. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time.\n\nIs this normal?

To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area. You can get all kinds of foods there, ranging from Irish pub to mediocre Chinese food to sushi to Gelato. My personal favorite is currently the mac and cheese shop, but that's not the point.\n\nWhen I was in high school and come into Boston on my own, I would always make a bee line to the Greek shop in Faneuil Hall. During my first time there, I noticed the food item called \"tzatziki - a kind of Greek yogurt.\" Coming from East Bumfuck, NH, I didn't know much about many other cultures' food stuffs, but I certainly knew about Greek yogurt!\n\nI don't know why I choose this, because I hated yogurt at the time (\"it has live bacteria in it!\" I can't explain the logic in that argument if I tried,) but I decided to order it. The people at the counter looked at me and were like, \"Okay, tzatziki aaaaaand?\" And then I cheerfully replied with, \"Oh, and a Nantucket Nectar!\"\n\nThey just looked at me, reached into the display case, and slid the solid near-2 cup tub of tzatziki over to me. I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon. It tasted great, but after like five or more bites it caused that reaction where your body is just like, \"Okay, you need to cool it with that stuff.\"\n\nI proceeded to order tzatziki every time I went to Faneuil Hall for a solid year. I couldn't figure out why everyone around me looked at me with mild disgust/bewilderment. Until I looked at the ingredient list for an online recipe for tzatziki.",

Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. \n\nWe went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)\n\nI would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.\n\nSorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.",
        "10": "POST: So I did some looking around at different models of wrist mount GPS units. Cost and functionality were the biggest concern. I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",

I was able to calculate my BMR (By the way is there one calculator that is better than the others? I got a few different numbers.)

Most of the provided resources provide diets to try don't seem like they would lend themselves well to everyday/lifetime eating. I don't know how to eat healthy. The last time I tried to truly get in good shape I did it all wrong. I'm talking eating only 800-900 calories a day, counting obsessively, cutting out all my favorite foods, and interspersed with bouts of binging on aforementioned foods.

I thought to myself, \"Why don't I just blow my nose in the shower, I mean, it's all just going to go down the drain anyway?\" \n\nSo I let it rip. Huge chunks of mucus came flying out my nose and onto the bottom of the tub. They were actually so big that I had to intentionally get water to flow onto them to make them move. I got out of the shower, feeling MUCH better with myself, and put my clothes on. As I was downstairs getting the last of my stuff together, I could hear my roommate getting up and walking into the bathroom. I was then serenaded by the lovely sounds of her screaming, \"Oh my f***** god!\" I half-jogged upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I know guys have needs, but can you **PLEASE** keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\"\n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had just gotten a new drain catch and all of my nasty phlegm was stuck in it. I quickly caught on and started telling her that it wasn't what she thought and I was just really sick and I just had to blow my nose and it's not that, etc. She was listening to none of it and was still just staring into the tub with an appalled face on. As I bantered, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the fuss was about, and before I could even try to explain what happened, he looked into the tub and started absolutely hollering. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it wasn't *that*, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and told them to take a deep wiff of it. Then both turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus sitting in my palm.

It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.",

Mike tells me that nobody's seen or heard from Joey in years and messaged him through a fake Facebook account and Joey is moving across the country to get away from parents, but in doing this he is moving in with Mike. \n\nSo I'm shocked at dinner and the rest of the drive as Mike also talks about the huge probability of them being together.

We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?",

He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it.

I understand that I can meet more people who are into a similar lifestyle as mine (thank god my girlfriend is an active person), but I've known these guys for so long, I just wish I could motivate them into losing weight and being active - they have no idea what kind of life they're missing.",
        "49": "POST: My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness. We have had real problems with him pulling on the lead, and the Mekuti harness has worked wonders, but didn't eliminate the problem. He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it. If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt. If I'd known these relatives were going to put one on him, I wouldn't have let them look after him. Still, it works and doesn't hurt him, my only worry is it'll do psychological damage somehow.",

Of course I don't show her any of this, but this is a fucking awful and paralyzing feeling I would like to stop having. I'm used to being pretty independent and having enough stuff in my life going on that I normally wouldn't be like that.

Things progressed fairly quickly; after a month she told me she loved me and began referring to herself as my girlfriend- this signaled to me that we were an \"official\" relationship. \n\nAnyways we both come from different states, and would be long-distance during our summer break- we'd both be back at school in mid-august. Before we left, she told me she didn't want to be in a long-distance relationship and that she didn't know if she would want to remain exclusive over the summer break. I saw this as essentially the end of our relationship and I told her that I would be moving on. \n\nThis is where things got complicated, as what I said seemed to really upset her. She asked why we couldn't \"just be friends and talk\" over summer then get back together in the fall, and I ignored her for a few days before I ended up breaking down and resuming contact with her. We are still talking and she has at times mentioned plans of what we'll do together when we come back to school, but I just don't know.\n\nWe aren't in an \"official\" relationship, but I feel as if I'm being used; she wants to be single over the summer, but wants me to hang around so we can get back together in the fall. I think this is unfair and I don't like the idea of us going from a relationship to being friends to back to a relationship whenever she wants. \n\nI do have very strong feelings for her, but I don't like the idea that she wants to be single while we're apart but then get back together if nobody better comes along.",

However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  \n\nSimilar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.

We would hang out together, kiss and stuff, and then nothing again.\n\nWell, last week I get a message, that she is getting married with that \"friend\" (few days before that, she told me that she still likes me, and kissed a bunch).

Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group.

I work in HR and have 3 roommates and rarely get a moment to breath. So I recently got a chance to take a lengthy vacation, and I want to use it to take a cross-country road trip I've wanted for a long time. My plan is for it to take around 3 months, I'll be stopping at several national parks, big cities, and visiting my brother. \nThe issue here is that I told my best friend about it and she has assumed that I want her to come as well, since she's recently graduated and this would be a good time for her. While I love my best friend, this is defeating the purpose of the trip. Best friend is extremely extroverted, does not understand the concept of wanting to do something alone. She's also rather princessy, and would likely complain about a lot of the hikes/nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, and enjoy some peace and quiet for once in my life. I know that 3-months in each other's faces would probably cause a fight, and that's the last thing I want to deal with on this trip. Is there a way I can tell her this is something I want to do alone, or should I just bring her and hope for the best? Would I regret going alone and halfway through, wish I had some company?",

We had made an agreement to compromise that if I waited for her for 2 years to finish the master she would come back with me to America.\n\nAfter her coming to visit my family, my parents told me that the feeling they received from her is that she wouldn't come to America after school, and would make excuses to try and keep me in Europe.\n\nI currently am working at a dead end job in Europe and know that I can come back to America and make much more money and be much happier with my life, but it feel so guilty about leaving her since I made a promise that I wouldn't give her up for a job.\n\nWe recently had a big fight and it put a big strain on our relationship, but she apologized and things have been getting to how they were. I'm just confused. My parents and friends tell me I should just do what's right for me, go for the job that I really want.\n\nI still love her, and I know she really loves me.. I just feel leaving her would devastate \n\nWhat should I do?",

My friends from country A are doing a month-and-a-half long trip to country B. Since my family lives in country B, I suggested that my friends, when they get to the city we live at, stay at our house so they don't have to pay for hotels and my parents could show them around.\n\nThe problem, as I found out, is that I *cannot deal with it*. \n\nI cannot stand the thought that my friends and my parents are making memories (in the most literal sense) without me. Like, these are two groups of people that have only come together because of me, and the fact that I am not there and that they are doing (fun) stuff together unrelated to me is making me really anxious. Basically, my parents are taking them out to restaurants/attractions and are basically being awesome for showing my friends around the city.\n\nI remember having this as a kid too, it just hasn't surfaced in a while. When I was about 6 or 7, it was my mom's turn to carpool the kids from school and everyone got to the car before me, and hence waited for like a minute until I got there. When I found out that they had all waited together for me (for a really insignificant amount of time, no one cared) I broke down and cried. I remember everyone being really confused and didn't understand when I tried to explain.\n\nSo, definitely something I need to talk to my therapist about, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever encountered something like this and what are people's thoughts on this.\n\nIt's like a weird mixture of FOMO/jealousy/homesickness. I realize this is not normal.",

The house is in a quiet town, kind of suburb-ish. The backyard ends with woods and hiking trails. \n\nAnyways, my 80 year old aunt said she had a litter of kittens living underneath her porch. The only human contact they had was her feeding them in the morning, which she couldn't afford to do for much longer. My sister and I went on July 14 and spent an hour luring one into a cat carrier. We surprised our mom and she was not too happy at first. Neither our mom, nor the kitten, would talk to us for 2 days haha. We discussed that the kitten was mine. I would be taking care of him and he'd be coming with me to my new apartment. Things got much better after 3 days. We discovered he was a boy kitty and I named him Caesar (I studied in Rome). He quickly became very sociable with humans and you could never tell he was ever feral. \n\nMy mom has had two male yellow Labradors since 2003 and a female cat since 2005. Caesar was scared of the dogs at first but now they love each other. The cat is another story. Caesar is a tiny energetic fur ball and always wants to play. He charges straight at her and she's just not about that life. They've never physically fought but she does hiss when he's nearby. For 10 years she always liked to go outside during the daytime to hunt smaller animals and chill with the dogs. I let her out yesterday morning and she hasn't been back since. She has a collar on but no phone# tag. \n I now have this looming feeling that she ran away because of Caesar. I hate that I'll never know for sure and he'll be moving with me in a few days.",

Excited with the idea, she agreed.\n\nAt the moment, I am a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure.

Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day.

        "119": "POST: My friend picked up a dog two days ago from a shelter, an eleven month old female husky/shepherd (possibly German Shepherd?) mix. She is super sweet most of the time, but she growled at my friend's mother, and at my friend when she was going to pick up a stick, then the dog nipped at one of her friends because the girl tried to push the dog down. The bite ended up drawing blood, and since it was so soon after getting the dog (and apparently the shelter released the dog without her rabies shot), my friend called the shelter to see what to do. They told her she had to quarantine the dog for 10 days, which she had to do at the shelter. When she took the dog in, she described the behavior above and the woman at the shelter strongly recommended turning the dog over to be euthanized because she was too \"unpredictable\" and could be dangerous. My friend felt she didn't have much choice in the matter and turned the dog over. I'm not sure if she can even get her back now (she's in the quarantine process at the moment), but my question is whether there is training that is likely to help this kind of behavior? She showed no aggression towards me whatsoever, but my friend is worried she'll be too dangerous to take out in public or to have people come over. She wants a dog she'd be able to take out with her to public places, but she's also been crying all day about the dog being put down. I'd really like to believe she could train the dog to be better, but is random aggression something that can be gotten rid of? If the responses are unpredictable, what can you really do?",

I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. \n\nThe next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all.

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?",

I am house-sitting for them while they are on vacation and taking care of their parrots. Let me explain why this infestation is so weird.\n\nMy parents have 2 dogs that are on the best flea medication that they can get and the dogs 100% do NOT have fleas, the fleas are localized only to the basement, where the dogs don't go (in fact, the dogs aren't even here right now). The fleas are in the basement, where my parents keep 4 eclectus parrots and 2 cockatoos that I am watching while they are away. \n\nThe basement is unfinished-- there is NO carpet down there, but there is an old sofa located near the birds' cages, but we have flea-bombed the basement twice before my parents left for vacation and the fleas have not been killed. What is unusual is that fleas don't usually (and aren't as far as I know) feed on parrots, so the parrots are not serving as a host for them. \n\nI am going directly from my parents' place to my girlfriend's when they return from their trip, and she has a cat that is not on any flea medication. I am trying to make absolutely sure that her cat does not get fleas from me. I have absolutely no idea how the fleas are still alive downstairs, but I want to try and kill them off. Flea-bombing is dangerous to the birds and we have to take them all out of the basement for several hours when we do it, and I can't do that alone, so I am trying to find a way to kill the fleas that is not harmful to the birds and doesn't require me to move them from the basement (because I can't).",

I love my family. I don't want them to feel like I'm judging them. My sister is gorgeous. My parents are wonderful, beautiful people. I would like to have their support, but I don't think I can ask for it. My father, especially, wouldn't give up junk food if I asked them to do it with me...and asking them to do it with me feels like an even bigger slap in the face.

I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year.

She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?\n     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch?

I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her.

We started dating seriously about a month ago and he refers to me as his girlfriend.  \n\nWithin the past two days we've realized we are different.  He's conservative with traditional values and I'm more liberal and unconventional.  It's almost a good thing because he's grounding me a little more and I'm opening up his mind to different ways of thinking.  However, I've realized that he's a bit self absorbed.  Not in a narcissistic way but he only seems to be able to relate things through himself.

Bodies are natural systems, respect yours, it can only change so much so fast. The changes some people here are making are so all encompassing that encountering these problems means you deserve a pat on the back because they represent just how far you've come. Plateau after losing 100lbs? It makes me think \"oh, you're frustrated? And are you virtually unrecognizable from who you were last year? Are you able to fucking enter a gym without feeling awkward? Let alone exercise without feeling like death?\".

Once I got to the Fortaleza airport the flight got delayed a couple of hours but the TAP staff guaranteed us that we wouldn't miss the transfer flight in Lisbon even though it would be a very tight time schedule. Once in Lisbon we (pretty much everyone who was going to Stockholm) ran to the gate just to be denied boarding under the excuse that our luggage wont make it to this flight so we couldn't board, when asked if they could just let us board anyway and then send our luggage the TAP staff girl just said they wont do it. We all went to the transfer desk, pretty upset, only to find a huge line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. From the 3 attendants in the transfer desk, only 1 was working and the other two just calmly said to us \"We cant help you, you should get in line and wait over there.\" There were pregnant women, people with babies, elderly and everyone stressing out because it has been over 2 hours and the line hasnt move a thing. Soon enough chaos starts and I hear the TAP woman screaming to a customer \"You shut the fuck up! And you too sir!\" (in portuguese). \n\nThats when I pick up my phone and start filming when a lady which was in line with us says: \"You better put that down, you dont have any permission to film here and if you continue, I am allowed to throw your phone away.\" I said it would be illegal of me to publish it but Im filming it to myself and I can do it. She said she was from the press and she knows the law and I cant do that. I didnt want any trouble because it was already a mess over there so I put my phone down and told the lady to fuck off and so we stayed in line until after much trouble, we managed to get home the next day. \n\nSo reddit?

I know it's crap and I've tried to before, but I just get a strong feeling of dread and I just can't do it.\n\nI know my friends love me and I hang out with someone maybe once, twice a week but it's never in a group and I'm always jealous of people that can have groups of people together like that and hanging out and stuff. \n\nI guess I just want to find stuff that will improve my self esteem, and maybe help me figure out what to do with my bf.",

They are narrow-minded straight ticket Republican voters, none of them have ever gone to college, and they all love modern pop country music; not that I mind, I just think that says a lot about a person.\n\nNow, I could deal with those differences if they stopped there. The deeper issues are grounded in their ignorance of my intrinsic personality and their obstinacy towards simply trying to understand. I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features in high school and then Bipolar 1 later on. On many days, all I can do is lie in the dark and list reasons to continue living.\n\nThis frequent inability to do anything is viewed as lazy by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. However, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.\n\nI have stayed with friends on multiple occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.\n\nI really just want to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented on. How do I get out of this mindset and become the person I want to be?",

Then today, a friend of a Bob came by and said that Bob sold it to someone else, Jim. Bob never transferred thr title over to himself when he bought the car. Instead, he sold it to Jim. Jim tried to go get tags in his name, but can't because the title is still under my name. Bob and friend gave Jim my number and said that they aren't going to deal with the situation and Bob changed his number.Now Jim wants me to go with him to the DMV and sign the title over to him. That isn't legal, I think. Because I sold the car to Bob, and I already turned in the bill of sale/notice of transfer to the tax collector So isn't this out of my control and Bob's problem?

Not to mention the fact that I'd never really experienced being so gratuitously complimented by a member of the opposite sex. We've been dating for nearly a year and she hasn't slowed down in telling me how \"hot\" and \"perfect\" I am, and how she can't find a single flaw with me (these are her words mind you; I'm a pretty humble guy, probably a hard 7 in terms of looks, and am not perfect by any means). The more I hear it, the more cringe-worthy it becomes. The worst part is that she uses it as a metric for her own self-deprecation, saying how she needs to \"work out twice a day just to be hot enough for me\" when I persistently tell her that I am perfectly happy with the way she looks. She confesses her adulation for me on a daily basis pretty much, saying things like \"I worship pretty much everything about you\" and \"I don't know what I'd do if you left me.\" I love pretty much everything else about her, but this one tiny problem is quite maddening and I feel like I'm becoming less attracted to her the more she says these things.

When he came up to me, he started with the usual sleaze about how we must be cousins because we both drive BMWs.

Oh, and there was a $2 tax on the damn thing so it actually came out to $12.\n\nHe ran my card, handed me a receipt, and the transaction was over. I'm sure he felt good about having basically hustled me into walking over there under the impression that I'd get a free can and then actually making a sale.

Now you can actually keep your word,\" and got back in my car and drove off.\n\nIt felt good doing this and I'd love to hear some stories of similar things that you may have done to help others at your cost, perhaps to prove a point or just to flat out pay it forward.",

Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one.

If any one can list a bit ''less tourist-y'' locations or less known yet still interesting it would be also great. \nI don't speak German well, is it possible to communicate with locals in English? Girlfriend does speak German but I'd like to participate in talking. And what are prices in general there?",

Mandarin is a whole new language to me.\n\nNow I replied to her in english, explaining that I have no idea what she needs. At which point she she starts to cry even harder and louder and wraps her arms around her head... I was thinking wtf...

No more cooking with garlic or onion (which is devastating for me, because I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THE SHIT OUT OF THOSE INGREDIENTS).

This wouldn't really be that bad, considering when we first started dating we only saw each other for a short time during the week; we mostly communicated through an instant messenger. However, I think that the distance and different circumstances have highlighted a glaring fact- we really don't have all that much in common. When we were in highschool, we could hide this by talking about classes and the like, but now that we don't have any classes, teachers, or experiences in common, our chatting has dried to just about nil.\n\nI am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing.

We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together.

An exclamation point takes no extra time to type in an e-mail and if a student comes to you during their own free time to show you something they thought was interesting and relevant, chances are they have taken a liking to you.

I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.

However a few people left from the front so I trained up there with her today for 2 hours. \n\nIt went fine, we laughed and chatted, got to know each other a bit and we were both smiling a lot.

I learned today that she's a year older than me (she's 17) and going to uni next year. I can't stop thinking about her and I don't know what to do. She was so nice to me but I might never see her again plus if she's older than me is that weird? I mean where do I go from here? She's clever, we have a similar personality and I really really like her, a lot but I don't know how she feels about me.

She said yes to go out with me, but when I invite her out on a date, she says she wants to get to know me better before we jump in to anything.\n\nOk. I get that. We just start hanging out here and there. Get to know each other. I learn that she's had issues with her weight. It's a big problem for her. Not a problem for me. Fast forward to last Saturday (3/26), and she tells me that she's failing school and wants to focus on herself right now and isn't looking for a relationship. I was pretty broken up because it came out of nowhere and I thought things were going great.\n\nI've still talked to her these past few days like nothing happened. Nothing relationship related, though. Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, \"Bae\" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways.\n\nLast night, she sent me a snap that just said, \"Wow.\" Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.\n\nI asked a few of my friends about their opinion on the situation and they said she's just trying to control me. I just have no idea what I should do. Hell, I'm still confused and not sure how I really think about it.",

I want to know if this is as messed up as I think it is, or if I'm overreacting. \n\nMy girlfriend uses birth control, so we have sex without condoms, but as an extra precaution when I come, I pull out and come on her. The last time we had sex, right after I came, she commented about how much nicer it was that it all sort of pooled into one place (I pull her close to me and it has nowhere to go), unlike her ex, who I guess splattered all over her. \n\nI fully understand that I'm not the only guy she's had sex with. I may even have been open to talking about it in some other context. But to me, when I literally just pulled out and came on you, the last thing I want to hear is anything about your ex, and especially nothing comparing sex with me to sex with him. It threw me off my game for a minute and I got cold/distant. She complained that my reaction hurt her feelings and I could tell she wanted me to apologize or something. It was very late and I was tired, so I did. \n\nThe more I think about it, though, the more it bothers me. I feel like I was right. She's going to think whatever she's going to think, but to vocalize about sex and ex in the same sentence when I was just inside you seems like the height of rudeness. \n\nAm I wrong to feel this way?

The things I saw them do was terrifying. Some of these guys have girlfriends!. These are guys in their 30's and they were dry humping young girls who looked not much older than 16, Im guessing teenagers who just turned 18 were having too much alcohol to hold down. If the security guard didn't interfere I'm pretty sure 3 of the guys would end up having sex with the same girl on the dance floor or who knows they might of all joined in. \n\nThis wasn't a boys night out their main and only aim was trying to hook up with randoms, but it wasn't one on one type hook up. 2 or 3 of them would be making out with the same girl the other 2 would be humping really aggressively against another drunk young girl, I'm guessing they were trying to get some \"group activity\" going. \n\nI couldn't believe this was what they f*ing called \"boys night out\". Bf said \"yeah they get a little out of hand sometimes but they're not hurting anyone, its all consensual\" \n\nI started wondering what it is my bf does when I'm not around since he doesn't dance and his buddies are all busy trying to hookup with the same person. Does he just sit quietly in the corner and drink or does he join them ? \n\nHe has cheated on me before, he kissed a girl at one of his friends birthday party and I only found out through a mutual friend. We took a break and tried to rebuild trust and its been good. But now he wants to go clubbing this weekend with the \"boys\" again. \n\nI don't want him to go. Am I being controlling ?

Throughout our relationship I have been a dumbass and flirted with girls, even sent some pics that I shouldn't have.  This has happen not just once but about three times.  However, in the last year I wanted to get my shit together because she is a pretty kick ass girl.\n\nI don't know why I sent naked pics and flirted like I did while in a relationship.  It just something I got a thrill from doing (and in the end, help me get off).  I would feel guilty about it afterwards though.  \n\nMy partner's father cheated on her mother and hurt her pretty good by it.

That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started going on casual dates and meeting new people. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life. A few weeks ago, I met this guy at a party, and we started flirting, nothing crazy, kissed, then I left.

I live in North Philadelphia, not the nicest place, so I don't hang around the fence but every day as I pass, the dog is laying either on the pavement (Next to about 10 piles of it's droppings) or in this wooden shack looking dog house.

With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again.

Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has.

It is natural for one to feel envious of their partner's previous relationships, as they represent a time when their love was not yet shared.

Love is a journey, and each relationship is a unique and special experience. It is through the sharing of love and intimacy that we grow and evolve as individuals, and it is through this growth that we are able to truly appreciate and cherish the love we have in the present.

We dated for a year before breaking up due to differences in our expectations for how long our dating would continue before marriage. I prefer a shorter dating period, while my partner feels that every aspect of her life must be perfectly in place before marriage, regardless of how long that takes. After getting back together, we have been more clear about our motivations, opinions, aspirations, and disagreements. We have travelled together, spent family holidays together, and always been in open communication. However, in the past 1-2 months, we have been having more difficulty with the depth and frequency of our conversations, which has made my partner uncertain about our relationship's future and how much I care for her. I am someone who is easygoing, patient, and feels loved by just spending quality time together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I only expect to have thought-provoking and deep conversations with my closest friends and family perhaps once a month, and somewhat more with my SO. My partner, on the other hand, is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time. I'm wondering if this is normal, if it's a real problem or if one of us is being unreasonable, and if anyone can relate.

I found the best deal on Amazon, but I didn't want to wait 1-2 weeks for shipping, so I went to Best Buy instead. I found a coupon for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products, and when I went to the store, I was greeted by a cute girl who happened to be an employee. She told me she loved the 305, even though it's huge, and we chatted about running and marathons. She was very pleasant and informative, and I hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nAt the cashier, the 305 rang up at $160, but I mentioned the web site price was $150 and they price matched it. Then I gave them the 20% off coupon, but it wouldn't scan. The cashier tried typing in the number, but it still wouldn't take it. So he tried again, and this time it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" or heart rate monitor, as well as any other brand of fitness GPS. Here's a link to the coupon, hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",

The protagonist of this tale has emerged from such a relationship, only to find themselves embarking on a new journey with a familiar face. The initial encounters were marked by a palpable tension, as both parties struggled to find their footing in this unfamiliar territory. But as time went on, the ice began to thaw, and the conversation flowed more freely. The protagonist, however, was left feeling disconnected, as if they had not reached the level of intimacy they had hoped for. Is this a reflection of their own insecurities, or a sign that the other party is not as interested as they had hoped? And is it appropriate to send a message expressing one's desire to continue the relationship? These are the questions that plague the protagonist's mind, as they navigate the treacherous waters of the dating world.",

I'm what most would consider a hardcore gamer, and as most people into this, they usually cherish and collect their favorite games and such. Today I skipped work because I woke up feeling like something had banged on my left side, hurting all over (ear infection, it's a reoccurring thing, I need to get this checked more often than not.) and decided to stay home and rest a bit more. I stayed home all day and at about 6 my dad rolls around to pick me up to go to the ER to see what's going on with my ear. During the following hour and a half I spent on the ER to get this checked and pick up the prescription the doctor gave me, I get home and find some clothing on my porch, lying on the path to my entrance. My dog was feasting on some plastic bag and at first I thought it was just some kids who'd have thrown a bag of old clothing onto my yard. As soon as I get up to my room though, things took a dire turn for me. I froze, looking baffled at what was right in front of me. My monitor was all crooked and the cables were off, and I look to the left and see this gaping hole where all my consoles were. Then it finally sunk into me: Someone robbed my house. Shit Shit Shit!",

We are now back together and met up overseas and travelled for a few weeks before she went travelling by herself for a few weeks. I have noticed that she keeps in touch with her ex-boyfriends, one in particular, who she has told me a bit about but overall been very closed about it. She is going to his country visit and all she has told me is that she is staying with a \"friend\" there who she met when she lived there. I'm about 90% sure it's him. My issue is not that I mind her seeing an ex boyfriend, it's that she is not open about it and still doesn't tell me when I ask her who she is staying with. What is the best way to bring up the fact that this makes me uncomfortable? I am going to try to address this on skype.

He is considering doing it for me and during or after summer its either going to work out or not. My question is.. Has anyone ever been in this type of situation before and how did it work out?

I am currently 19 years old and have been subjected to a lifetime of mistreatment and disregard. My first visit to the gynecologist was a traumatic experience, as the doctor was rough and insensitive, causing me to come out crying. Instead of offering support and understanding, my father dismissed my pain and told me to \"forget it\" and \"drop it.\" This is just one example of the many ways in which my father has failed to provide me with the care and attention I deserve. I also had a boyfriend for a year, but my father never bothered to meet him and didn't seem to care when I told my parents that my boyfriend had abused me. I have also overheard my father saying nasty things about me when he thought I wasn't listening. Despite all of this, I am currently in college and unable to move out of my father's house. I am writing this letter to bring attention to the abuse and neglect I have suffered and to encourage others in similar situations to seek help and support.

However, after dating someone or being in a relationship for a while, I often feel the need or gravitate towards someone else who sparks my interest, even if I know it's not a long-term deal. From there, I get fulfillment out of learning and talking to them about their views, life, etc., and also the enjoyment of their different hobbies, likes, or experiences we do together.\n\nIdeally, I know I want a family and kids one day, but I am not sure how I can stay in a long-term relationship with this mindset and feeling. I wonder if I haven't found \"the one\" or been in true love, or if I am capable of just wanting to be with one person. However, I am determined to overcome this challenge and find a way to stay committed to one person. I am motivated to work on myself and my relationships, and I am confident that with time and effort, I can find a way to be happy and fulfilled in a long-term relationship.

Yet, for the protagonist of this tale, it has become a source of great turmoil and existential crisis. For five long years, they have been separated by a mere 250 miles, a distance that seems insurmountable in the face of their love. They have sacrificed time with their family, their own comfort, and even their own sanity in pursuit of this elusive connection. And yet, despite their best efforts, they find themselves seeing each other less and less, their weekends together becoming a rare and precious commodity. The protagonist's guilt over their neglect of their family weighs heavily on their conscience, and they are torn between their love for their partner and their duty to their parents. The prospect of moving in together seems like a distant dream, as the cost of living in their partner's area is prohibitively high. The protagonist's partner, on the other hand, has a large extended family nearby, and seems to have no qualms about moving away from their own parents. The protagonist is left feeling selfish and childish, as their partner dismisses their concerns and insists that they would still see their parents every fortnight. In the end, the protagonist is left feeling conflicted and uncertain, their love for their partner clashing with their sense of duty to their family.

However, in a moment of weakness, the author agreed to go to the haunted house, only to back out at the last minute, citing his anxiety as the reason. His girlfriend, who had been looking forward to the event, was understandably disappointed and upset, accusing the author of letting her down and waiting until the last minute to express his discomfort. The author apologized and offered to still go to the haunted house if his girlfriend really wanted to, but she was too upset to accept his offer.

After a while, she broke up with the guy, and I watched as some of my friends tried to swoop in.

Everything was going well until she flaked on me, and I found out that it had happened to another friend who had tried the kiss-ass method.\n\nFast forward to now, and we're all still hanging out, but there's a veil of passive-aggressiveness, and I see people still trying to get with her. To make matters worse, one of my friends keeps obsessing over her in my presence, which just reminds me of my own underlying loneliness since I've never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with, but I don't know how to deal with the consequences of such a move.",

While some of my friends went out front to smoke, I stayed behind with another guy and we had a great time talking.

We headed over there and took a seat on the swings, but unfortunately, the support beam holding up the swings snapped in half and the swing set collapsed. I felt awful and my friend was understandably upset, but he was kind enough to get over it quickly. I offered to help fix it or pay for a new one, but he told me not to worry about it. His parents weren't at all mad and wanted to get rid of it for a while, so I kind of did him a favor. However, his 3-year-old brother was heartbroken by the incident, which was understandable.

The author also mentions that they had just wiped down the counter and were talking to a server, and that they have worked in restaurants their whole life and understand the importance of cleaning. The author then describes a conversation with a manager, where the manager asked if everything was okay and mentioned that the food runner had said that the author was just talking and not working at all.

It's truly remarkable that someone who has been working since the age of 16 and earns a paltry $12,000 per year would even consider applying for a credit card, let alone a secured one. The fact that they work at Best Buy and are considering a store card is simply mind-boggling. It's as if they're actively seeking out the most inconvenient and impractical way to build their credit.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of using a secured credit card to \"use it anywhere\" is laughable. Secured credit cards are designed for individuals with poor or no credit history, and as such, they typically come with high fees and low credit limits. The notion that this individual would be able to use a secured credit card \"anywhere\" is simply preposterous.\n\nAs for the choice of credit card issuer, it's clear that this individual has no idea what they're doing. Credit unions and Capital One may be popular choices, but they're far from the only options available. And the idea of choosing a credit card based on the type of card (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, AMEX) is simply absurd. The type of card has no bearing on the individual's ability to build their credit.\n\nIn conclusion, this individual's plan to build their credit is a prime example of the dangers of financial illiteracy. It's clear that they have no understanding of the complexities of credit and are simply grasping at straws in an attempt to improve their financial situation.

These are important questions to ask yourself as you consider the possibility of having children, as they can help you to clarify your own goals and desires.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is your relationship with your partner. How do you feel about the idea of raising a child together? Are you both on the same page when it comes to your parenting styles and values? These are important questions to ask yourself as you consider the possibility of having children, as they can help you to determine whether or not you are ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.\n\nIn addition to these personal considerations, it is also important to take into account the practical aspects of having children. This includes factors such as your financial situation, your living arrangements, and your career goals. It is important to be realistic about these factors and to consider how they might impact your ability to provide for and care for a child.\n\nAs you continue to explore this decision, I encourage you to seek out the support and guidance of trusted friends, family members, and professionals. These individuals can offer valuable insights and perspectives, and can help you to navigate the complex emotions and considerations that come with this decision.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate my support for you as you navigate this important decision. It is natural to feel uncertain and overwhelmed at times, but it is important to remember that you are not alone in this process",
        "44": "Dear heartbroken soul, it sounds like your relationship was a rollercoaster of emotions, with highs of happiness and lows of jealousy and tension. It's unfortunate that one fight \"screwed everything up,\" but it's not surprising given the amount of tension and hurt that had built up between you two. It's also not surprising that you made a mistake and spent the night together after breaking up, as emotions were running high and you were both likely feeling vulnerable. It's understandable that you want to get her back, but it's important to respect her decision and give her space. It's possible that she still has feelings for you, but she may need time to process her emotions and figure out what she wants. In the meantime, focus on taking care of yourself and moving forward. It's okay to feel sad and hurt, but try to find healthy ways to cope with your emotions, such as talking to friends or seeking professional help if needed. Remember, relationships are complex and it's not always possible to get back together, but it's important to learn from the experience and grow as a person.",
        "45": "Hey everyone, I'm here to share some exciting news! My roommate and I have decided to embark on a new adventure together - we're going to be roommates for another two years! We've been working together for a while now, and I've always been impressed by his ability to keep up appearances. He's a master of the art of pretending to have his act together, even though he hardly ever leaves the apartment except to go to work. He's also a pro at avoiding buying household goods and cleaning up after himself, and he definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apartment. But hey, he's a nice guy, and I'm sure he's just oblivious and inconsiderate in a charming way.\n\nAnyway, we used to smoke weed together from time to time, and I was totally cool with it. But then it started turning into 12-hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but he slowly started to do it again. Finally, one night, I had had enough and I called him out, and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month, he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I agreed, under the condition that she wouldn't be in the apartment all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.). But here we are, almost two weeks later, and she's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was), but he never replied. I texted him again this morning, and still crickets. My friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, taking out the trash, and having no alone time in my own apartment). I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him, but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm excited to continue living with my roommate for another two years, and I'm sure we'll have many",
        "46": "I had always dated monogamously since the first date, and for reasons related to a past experience of trauma I opened myself up to the possibility of dating around. This is actually a healthy development for me and is one encouraged by my therapist. I'm seeing three different guys right now. One is an old fling who, to be honest, is mostly just somebody I have a more physical relationship with. Pretty simple, no complications. The second is a guy I've been seeing for about two months now. We have lots of fun together, great convo, but nothing has been defined yet. While I can't prove it without flat-out asking, I'm pretty positive he's seeing other people, too. I'm also pretty sure what he and I have is a really casual dynamic. It's not no strings attached, but it's not a serious relationship, either. The third is a guy I've started seeing more recently. I really like him! He's smart, handsome, engaging\u2014if I'm going to be honest, he might be one I'd choose out of the three, but I'm not sure. It could just be the rush of getting to know someone new. (I felt like this for guy number two in the beginning, too). I've read number of articles online about the benefits of dating multiple people at once and what to do when you think you've found someone you'd like to focus all your attention and energy on. I'm not sure I'm cognizant of how to transfer that to my life, though. At what point do I make the decision to become exclusive with someone? I'm not sure how to navigate these waters, and I should admit I'm pretty bad at deciphering my own emotions. And do I disclose that I'm seeing other people? (My friends are actually split on that: Some say yes, others say no; some say monogamy is always assumed, others say it is never).",

        "49": "My 3 year old GSD x Husky rescue stayed with some relatives for a few days while my boyfriend and I moved house, and the relatives found an old choke chain to walk him with, instead of his Mekuti harness. We have had real problems with him pulling on the lead, and the Mekuti harness has worked wonders, but didn't eliminate the problem. He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it. If he ever started pulling on the lead so that the choker was tight, I would stop using it straight away. The last thing I want is my dog being hurt. If I'd known these relatives were going to put one on him, I wouldn't have let them look after him. Still, it works and doesn't hurt him, my only worry is it'll do psychological damage somehow.",

Right now, we are separated by the Atlantic Ocean for two more months, and every two days that I don't hear from her, I get into panic mode and start thinking that it's fucked and that I lost her. I'm used to being pretty independent and having enough stuff going on in my life that I normally wouldn't be like that, but this time, this girl, I just really like her too much and she is under my skin all the time. I write her songs and make her all kinds of little surprises that I know she enjoys a lot, but other than showing she loves it, she never really does the same for me. My question is, how can I reach a point in this relationship where I stop worrying that much that I'm going to lose her, and even better, how can I revert the situation to the one I'm used to, where she cares about me even more? I really like her and she can't care about me too much. Thanks.",

But then she said she didn't want to be in a long-distance relationship and that she didn't know if she wanted to be exclusive over the summer break. I was like, \"Okay, I guess this is the end of our relationship,\" but then she got upset and asked if we could just be friends and talk over the summer and get back together in the fall. I ignored her for a few days, but then I broke down and started talking to her again. We're still talking, and she's mentioned plans for when we come back to school, but I don't know what's going on. We're not in an \"official\" relationship, but I feel like I'm being used. She wants to be single over the summer, but she wants me to hang around so we can get back together in the fall.

I know, logically, that it's not a big deal, but it makes me feel less attracted to her. I don't fart that often, but when I need to, I go to the bathroom when she's around. I'm wondering if it would be okay to ask her to do the same. I've only been dating my current girlfriend for seven months, so maybe that's why I'm not comfortable with it yet.

He is the first person she has ever dated, and she really likes him, but he is not feeling the same level of affection towards her. He is worried that he should be feeling more affection towards her, and he is not sure if this is something that will occur later on as they see each other more. He never expected this to be a super serious relationship with marriage potential, but he feels like he should be feeling more affection towards her. He is also concerned about the fact that this girl is a real sweetheart and is super nice and happy. Her family already knows about him and all of her friends, and he is worried that if he were to end the relationship, it would really hurt her, which is not something he wants. He is wondering if there is a way to break it off in a non-depressing way and maintain her as a good friend.

However, there are a few potential obstacles that could prevent this from happening. Firstly, I have heard rumors that she is in an arranged marriage, although I have not confirmed this with her as she is private and may not want to discuss the matter. Secondly, we only have a few months left before she goes back home for a couple of months and then goes off to college, which I am only a junior in. It is unlikely that we will see each other again unless we end up going to the same college two years from now, which does seem likely as we plan on going to the same school. Thirdly, it seems that she has been hurt by a previous guy, and she has told me that she hates most guys at our school. My question is whether I should try to start a relationship with her.

We have been together for a long time, and I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner. However, I have never made a big deal out of sex, and I would not mind an open relationship. Unfortunately, my partner would never allow me to be with another man, so I don't feel comfortable being in an open relationship with him. He knows my views on sex, and he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, which he finds unreasonable. I understand that he is young and has only been with me, and he wants to explore sexually. But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one-sided open relationship. He said it's not about me, and he's upset when I mentioned I wanted to go to a bar some years ago, and he's not comfortable with it. I respected that, but about a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. I don't care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club, but I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me. Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him. I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.

        "60": "Background: I am a 21-year-old female and my partner is a 25-year-old male. He moved in with his old college roommates about a year ago, and they have been a negative influence on him. Before he moved in with them, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and attend church. Since he has moved in with them, he has gained about 30 pounds.

It seems like he makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I am not sure how to tell him this, as I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends. He already knows that I do not like his friends, as they give me a hard time and make me feel like crap. They have even reduced me to tears a few times.

As a straight man, I have always considered myself to be open-minded and accepting of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. However, in the last couple of months, I have come to the startling realization that gay men who act in a flamboyant manner can be quite annoying.\n\nIt is important to note that this is not a matter of hate or discomfort. I am against hate in any form and consider myself an ally of the LGBT community. I have had many close gay friends and have even kissed guys full on the lips in front of packed auditoriums without any trepidation. I also get along better with lesbians than with almost anyone else, as I find it relaxing to hang out with women without the tension of wondering if we are going to have sex.\n\nHowever, it is the acting gay - acting *really* gay - that annoys me. I understand that some individuals may feel the need to express their sexual identity, especially when they are just coming out or participating in a pride parade. But when I see adult men acting like total queens, I just want to tell them to grow the hell up. It feels the same as some good old boy chugging whiskey on his four wheeler wearing a Nascar hat and waving old glory on his way down to the still. Immature posturing. Blegh.\n\nI could be in the wrong here, and I might just be an asshole. This bothers me, as I have always tried to believe that people should be free to express themselves however they choose. I hope it's not the case, but are my feelings here prejudice? And, have you encountered this IRL? How do you feel about it? All love and respect to you, even if you hate me.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to embrace your true self and express your sexual identity in a way that feels authentic to you.

        "67": "Dear esteemed reader, I am writing to you today in hopes of seeking assistance for my canine companion, who has developed a rather peculiar habit of incessantly licking one particular spot on her body. This behavior has persisted for a year now, with four distinct spots being targeted, one of which has been the focus of her attention for several months. The incessant licking has resulted in the loss of fur and even infection, which I have attempted to treat with ointment. I have consulted with a veterinarian regarding my dog's apparent allergy, which has manifested as scaly skin and dandruff, but the cause remains undetermined. The licking issue, while mentioned, was not addressed directly. This situation has become increasingly stressful, as my father has suggested that I give up my dog in order to prioritize my own emotional needs. I have attempted to identify potential causes for the licking, such as boredom, but I have been attending college and have spent months solely in the company of my dog. I am aware that this behavior is not her fault, but it has eroded my trust in her. If she is left alone for even a brief period of time, such as when I am showering or she is in her kennel after a walk, she will immediately begin licking the affected area. I have tried various methods of wrapping the spot, but she has managed to remove them all, even when I am in the same room. I am in desperate need of guidance and any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I will be leaving my dog for a week to attend a family reunion in another state.

So, let us take a closer look at the situation and analyze the different elements at play. First, we must consider the role of technology in modern relationships. While it has made it easier to stay in touch with loved ones, it has also created new challenges. Texting, for example, can be a convenient way to communicate, but it can also lead to misunderstandings and a lack of emotional connection. It is important to find a balance between technology and face-to-face communication. Second, we must consider the role of individual preferences and communication styles. Some people may prefer texting over other forms of communication, while others may prefer face-to-face interactions. It is important to respect each other's preferences and find a way to communicate that works for both parties. Third, we must consider the role of effort and commitment in maintaining a relationship. Both parties must be willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work, whether it be through finding alternative forms of communication or making time for face-to-face interactions. In conclusion, the young woman's struggle to connect with her boyfriend on a deeper level is a common one in today's world. It is important to remember that communication is a two-way street and both parties must be willing to put in the effort to make it work. By analyzing the different elements at play, we can gain a better understanding of the situation and find ways to improve it. So, let us take action and work towards building stronger, more meaningful connections in our relationships.",

This woman, who shall remain nameless, has been plagued by commitment jitters and doubts about her future, career, and relationship. Despite her best efforts to communicate her concerns to her boyfriend, he remains steadfast in his belief that they are doing \"really great\" and that they will figure things out as they go. This woman, who is clearly a paragon of virtue and wisdom, has daydreamed of a future with her boyfriend, complete with a family and a happy life together. However, last night she had a dream that they broke up mutually, and it felt oddly satisfying.

She is torn between her love for her boyfriend and her doubts about their relationship, and she is unsure of how to proceed.

He has expressed his desire to marry me and have children, and I have agreed to follow him wherever his career takes him. However, recently he has been acting strange and distant, and I discovered that he has been sending texts to his ex from 5 years ago, telling her that he still thinks about her every second of every day and misses her. This behavior is cruel and has left me feeling like an idiot. I am a total wreck, but I am determined to take action and move forward. I will not let this setback define me, and I will use this experience as motivation to become a stronger and more resilient person. I will focus on my own goals and aspirations, and I will not let anyone else's actions hold me back. I am capable of achieving great things, and I will not let this setback keep me from reaching my full potential.

However, my best friend, who is extremely extroverted and does not understand the concept of wanting to do something alone, assumed that I wanted her to come along. She is also rather princessy and would likely complain about the hikes and nature things I have planned. I wanted to pack my dog up and go, but now I'm faced with the dilemma of telling her that this is something I want to do alone or bringing her along and hoping for the best. Would I regret going alone and halfway through, wish I had some company? This is a critical decision that requires careful analysis and consideration of the potential consequences.",

        "75": "So a couple weeks ago, I had the misfortune of running into a girl from high school at a club. In a moment of weakness, I gave her my number and have been subjected to an onslaught of texts ever since. \n\nLast week, I made the mistake of asking her out for drinks, and she responded with a vague \"maybe\" and a promise to \"definitely\" see me this week. Of course, she bailed on our plans, citing a previous night out as an excuse. \n\nI then asked her out again on Tuesday, and she once again said \"maybe,\" claiming she had plans with a friend. She finally texted me late yesterday afternoon to say she was \"busy.\" \n\nMy best friend, who works with her, got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and apparently thinks I've forgotten, and doesn't want to get into a relationship. She mentioned both of these things the night we got together, but also said she didn't like one night stands, so I have no idea what I was. \n\nHonestly, I just can't understand why someone would say they're up for going out with someone, and then do everything they can to avoid it. I'd begun to think she didn't want to as she wouldn't give me an idea when she could go out when I tried to ask her. \n\nI'm looking for advice on what to do next. I feel like she's attracted to me, but doesn't want to get too deep into things. Should I just ask her if she doesn't actually want to see me, or should I just stop trying to set stuff up with her and move on?",

By dividing one's savings into separate accounts for emergency funds and everyday expenses, one can ensure that they have a safety net in case of unexpected events while also maintaining a steady stream of income for their daily needs. This approach allows for a more disciplined and strategic approach to saving, as one can tailor their direct deposit paycheck to allocate a specific amount to each account each month. Additionally, by choosing a checking account that does not charge fees, one can avoid unnecessary expenses and maximize their savings. However, it is important to note that personal finance is a complex and multifaceted subject, and seeking the guidance of a financial advisor can be a valuable step in developing a comprehensive plan for managing one's money.

My great grandmother worked on a farm her entire life and was the oldest of eight siblings, four of whom were born before immigrating to the US. The family was not Jewish, but I am aware of the history of Jewish oppression in the region.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for one year now, and we have come to a fork in our relationship. I work abroad in Europe, and she is an European citizen. We met at work while she was doing an internship, finishing her bachelor's degree. When her internship finished, we continued to visit each other, and she told me that she wanted to do a master's program in Sweden, which is really far for me. We made an agreement to compromise, and I agreed to wait for her for two years to finish the master's program, and she would come back with me to America.\n\nHowever, after she visited my family, my parents told me that they felt that she wouldn't come to America after school and would make excuses to try and keep me in Europe. I am currently working at a dead-end job in Europe, and I know that I can come back to America and make much more money and be much happier with my life. But I feel guilty about leaving her since I made a promise that I wouldn't give her up for a job.\n\nWe recently had a big fight, which put a big strain on our relationship, but she apologized, and things have been getting back to how they were. I am confused because my parents and friends tell me I should just do what's right for me and go for the job that I really want. I still love her, and I know she really loves me, but I feel that leaving her would devastate her.\n\nIn this situation, it is important to analyze the pros and cons of each decision. On one hand, staying in Europe with my girlfriend would mean sacrificing my career and financial stability, but it would also mean being with the person I love. On the other hand, leaving her to pursue my career in America would mean sacrificing our relationship, but it would also mean achieving my goals and being happier with my life.\n\nUltimately, the decision is up to me, and I must weigh the pros and cons carefully. I must also consider the impact of my decision on my girlfriend and our relationship. I must be honest with her about my feelings and my plans, and I must be prepared to face the consequences of my decision, whether it be staying in Europe or leaving for America.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a difficult situation, and I must make a decision that is right for me and my",

I was in my bathroom and just got done putting my uniform on when I remembered I need to shave before I left or I would get my ass chewed out by drill instructors. So I went in my cabinet and grabbed my razor and my shaving cream. Then I thought to myself \"oh well let me put my contacts in so I can see what I'm doing. That fellow Redditors is when I fucked up. Now you have to realize it's about 5:30am at the time so I'm tired as hell. So I get my contact put it on my finger and go to grab the solution so I can put a drop or two in the contact before I put it in my eye.

        "96": "Hello, fellow denizens of the internet. I come to you today with a conundrum that is both perplexing and, dare I say, absurd. Allow me to set the stage: I am a citizen of country A, a high school graduate of country B, and a current resident of the United States of America. My friends from country A are embarking on a month-and-a-half long journey to country B, and I, in my infinite wisdom, suggested that they stay at my family's home in country B to save on hotel expenses and to receive a guided tour of the city from my parents.\n\nHowever, I have discovered that I am unable to cope with this situation. The thought of my friends and my parents creating memories without my presence is causing me great distress. It is as if these two groups of people, who have only come together because of me, are now engaging in activities that have nothing to do with me. My parents are taking my friends to restaurants and attractions, and they are being the epitome of hospitality. This is causing me great anxiety.\n\nI recall experiencing similar feelings as a child. When I was around 6 or 7 years old, it was my mother's turn to carpool the children from school, and everyone arrived at the car before me. They waited for me for a mere minute, and when I found out, I broke down in tears. Everyone was confused and did not understand when I tried to explain.\n\nI plan to discuss this issue with my therapist, but I am curious if anyone else has experienced something similar and what their thoughts are on the matter. It is a strange combination of FOMO, jealousy, and homesickness. I am aware that this is not a normal reaction.",

It's truly a shame that we couldn't maintain the level of emotional connection that we once had. However, I must say that I'm not surprised by this turn of events, given the hurtful things you said to me during our breakup and the pain you caused me while we were together. It's clear that our relationship was built on a foundation of mutual disrespect and emotional manipulation. Nevertheless, I'm glad that you apologized for your hurtful words and that we were able to maintain a semblance of friendship for a short time. However, it's clear that our attempts to remain friends were doomed from the start, as evidenced by your recent decision to ignore me and cut off all communication. I understand that you may be going through a difficult time, but your actions are hurtful and disrespectful. I hope that you can find the strength to move on from this painful situation and find happiness in your life. Sincerely, Your Former Friend.",

I feel really mad and can't help it, as I sacrificed time with my family and friends just to be with her while she stayed full time with her family and got super drunk at the school reunion. I'm planning not to drive there today and spend at least one more day with my family, but I want to do this mostly to show her I'm mad.

However, our female cat, who had always enjoyed going outside during the daytime, has not returned since I let her out yesterday morning.

Recently, she was asked to model for a clothing company startup, and she was excited about the idea. I'm a mixture of supportive, jealous, insecure, and unsure. The photographer in me is against the idea because it's unpaid and I feel they're taking advantage of her. The boy in me is jealous that she's so enamored with the idea and was so resistive to me initially. I'm also not comfortable with my girlfriend choosing to be ogled by people online, and I'm a bit possessive and insecure about it.

        "101": "In the realm of love, there is a delicate balance between passion and reason, between attachment and detachment. It is a journey of self-discovery and growth, where one must navigate the complexities of the heart and mind. In this tale of two souls, we find a young couple, bound by the threads of time and friendship, yet struggling to find harmony in their relationship. The protagonist, a 21-year-old woman, is a seeker of truth, a philosopher of the heart, who has experienced the bitter taste of failed relationships and the pain of her parents' divorce. She is a dreamer, a romantic, who sees the potential for a beautiful future with her boyfriend, a 22-year-old man who is her first love. Yet, their relationship is marred by arguments, passion, and a sense of attachment that threatens to consume them both. The protagonist is aware of her own flaws, her clinginess, her temper, and her sensitivity, and she longs to change, to become a better partner. But change is not easy, and she must confront her own emotional and self-esteem issues in order to find true happiness. The question remains: can she find the balance between passion and reason, between attachment and detachment, and create a relationship that is both fulfilling and sustainable? Or will she be forced to make the difficult choice of breaking up, in order to find herself and her true path in life? This is a story of love, growth, and the eternal struggle to find balance in the ever-changing landscape of the human heart.",
        "102": "In the grand scheme of things, the age difference between two individuals is but a mere speck in the vast expanse of time. It is a trivial matter, a mere blip on the radar of life. Yet, it is this very triviality that makes it so significant. For it is in the trivialities of life that we find the true meaning of existence. It is in the small, insignificant details that we discover the beauty and wonder of the universe. And so, it is with great irony that we find ourselves pondering the age difference between two individuals, for it is in this very act of pondering that we come to realize the true nature of love. Love is not bound by age, nor is it confined to the constraints of time. It is a force that transcends all boundaries, a force that knows no limits. And so, it is with great joy that we celebrate the love between these two individuals, for it is a love that is truly timeless.",

Not the typical \"books for men\" that you can find on Google, but rather works that offer a nuanced and empathetic exploration of what it means to be a man. I am particularly interested in understanding the emotional underpinnings of concepts such as \"respect,\" \"brotherhood,\" \"solidarity,\" and \"fortitude.\" These are the pillars of guy culture, which often seems to revolve around superficial things and a self-deprecating sense of humor. As someone who was raised by my mother and taught to view masculinity as a joke, I have long struggled with my own masculinity, berating it as \"stupid\" and dangerous. I have turned to philosophy in an attempt to address this, but it has left me feeling unfulfilled. I am hoping that through literature, I can gain a deeper understanding of the male experience and perhaps even find a way to embrace my own masculinity.",

Early in the relationship, I went to my friend's cousin's house to hang out, but my boyfriend didn't come. We were all hanging out and drinking, and another of my friend's cousins who I had kissed a few years back showed up. I got really drunk and the cousin was trying really hard to sleep with me, but I kept saying no and he knew I had a boyfriend. Eventually, I blacked out and found out in the morning that the guy kept trying to get me to sleep in his bed with him, which I refused. However, someone told me that I was leaning against him on the couch and he may have been kissing my neck. I felt absolutely disgusted after I found this out and had a huge talk with my friend. She thought it was best for me not to mention it to my boyfriend because it was a new relationship and I had been adamant that I didn't want to hook up with him. I hadn't really thought about it much until recently. About six months ago, I came to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol abuse problem and have been sober for three months. I've been seeing things much more clearly now and this event is really starting to bother me. I know nothing like this will ever happen again because I am confronting my problem and will never let myself be in that state again.

They've met me once and didn't see that I was good enough so it wasn't allowed no matter what she tried telling them. She's suffocated by them and doesn't know where she is on religion due to them forcing it on her. She definitely doesn't agree with a lot of their beliefs. We have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for 6 months, and I still have that feeling I got the the first week we dated. Now she broke up with me because we have been hiding it the whole time and she started getting frustrated with lying and being scared of them figuring out because the consequences would be pretty great. Neither her or I are in the position to move out so options on how this could work are very limited. Talking to them really isn't going to do anything because they're so deep in religion, that there's no if, ands, or buts. We're in a rough spot and are both really stressed out and would like to be together but them finding out would not be pretty. Does anyone have an suggestions or experience with this?

So, we had to bury her in her parents' family grave, with the intention of re-digging her out after two years to bury her alongside her husband. However, when we contacted her only living brother, he refused to allow us to bury her in her family's grave, claiming that his wife was very sick and he needed to reserve the space. Despite our protests, we were forced to rent a temporary grave. Two years later, his wife is alive and well, and we are left wondering why he was so adamant about reserving the space. It's a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of death, people can be selfish and inconsiderate. But we must not let this discourage us from honoring our loved ones and doing what is right.

I didn't think much of it. This past weekend she told me that this guy tried calling her saying he would try to break up our relationship. When I asked her the reasons why he would want to do that, she was not straightforward with me and I felt something was up. So I found the number of the other guy and called him up. Surprisingly, he said years ago she used to be madly in love him and went pscyho trying to ruin his life and trying to break up his relationships. He also said that on the friday before the weekend, she texted him asking to give her and a friend a ride from the bar. Furthermore, he said that they do text each other in a while. When I confronted my girlfriend about all this, she confessed and said everything was true. But she said the only reason she talked to him was to keep tabs as he used to be a big part of her life. As for the reason for asking for a ride, she said she was just drunk with her friend and needed  a ride home (I don't have a car). She said she didn't want to tell me about the truth because she didn't want me to get upset. But why did she lie and tell me he's a crazy stalker when in truth she was reciprocating? Also I was shocked she asked him for a ride while she was really drunk. She never told me any of this. In all honesty, I don't think she had the intention of cheating, but I just think she doesn't want to let go of the past. She still says she loves me and would never want him over me, which I believe. What scares me most is how she lied about the whole situation. I feel like my trust for her has been severely violated and I don't know how to move forward. Is this something I should forgive?

        "151": "Dear Highschool Junior, I am writing to you today to express my deepest sympathies for your upcoming Baskin Robins date with the girl you like. It is truly a tragedy that you have been reduced to a stuttering, awkward mess in her presence, despite your previous reputation as a fearless and confident individual. But fear not, for I have a solution that will not only save your date, but also make you the envy of all your classmates.\n\nFirst, let me assure you that your inability to speak in front of this girl is not a reflection of your intelligence or worth as a person. In fact, it is a sign of your deep and profound love for her. You see, when we are truly in love, our brains become overwhelmed with emotions and we are unable to form coherent sentences. It is a beautiful and poetic phenomenon that has been documented throughout history.\n\nSo, instead of trying to force yourself to speak, embrace your silence. Let your love for her shine through in your actions and gestures. Hold her hand, gaze into her eyes, and let your heart do the talking. Trust me, she will be swept off her feet by your silent, yet powerful, declaration of love.\n\nAnd if all else fails, just remember that you are not alone. Many great men and women have struggled with the same problem, including Abraham Lincoln, who was known to be a terrible public speaker. But he overcame his fear and went on to become one of the greatest leaders in American history. So, take heart, my friend, and know that you too can overcome this obstacle and become the confident, charismatic individual you were meant to be.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge you to embrace your awkwardness and let your love for this girl shine through. Remember, the greatest love stories are often the ones that are the most unconventional. So, go forth and conquer, my friend, and may your Baskin Robins date be the stuff of legends.\n\nSincerely, Your Motivational Coach",

When one partner is emotionally unavailable, it can create a sense of distance and disconnection that can be difficult to overcome. In this case, the narrator's girlfriend's emotional unavailability is a result of her past relationship and her inability to fully let go of her ex. This emotional baggage is affecting her ability to fully engage in the present relationship, and it is causing the narrator to feel frustrated and uncertain about the future of their relationship. The narrator's love for his girlfriend is strong, but he is struggling to find the right way to handle the situation.

I'm a fiercely independent woman, almost to a fault.  I kind of feel like it may be that I'm trying to prove something but I'm not sure what that is.  I met a guy about 5 months ago through some mutual friends.  We have a lot of common interests like guns, camping and generally having a good time.  We started dating seriously about a month ago and he refers to me as his girlfriend.  Within the past two days we've realized we are different.  He's conservative with traditional values and I'm more liberal and unconventional.  It's almost a good thing because he's grounding me a little more and I'm opening up his mind to different ways of thinking.  However, I've realized that he's a bit self absorbed.  Not in a narcissistic way but he only seems to be able to relate things through himself.  I put a lot of effort into being interested in his projects but he doesn't make an effort to being interested in my projects.  I can tell that issues from my last relationship are urging me to abandon ship immediately for fear of being hurt again and I wonder if I'm almost TRYING to find reasons to leave.  Basically, we have two issues.  I had basically conviced myself that I wanted to be alone but I found a guy I genuinely care about.  He makes me happy and the thought of being with him doesn't make me nauseous.  Secondly, are we incompatible or am I trying to make us incompatible?  If I'm already sensing he's a little self absorbed should I continue this relationship?",

Sounds simple, right?\n\nHowever, tonight, as I was texting her, I complimented her, and she told me that she wasn't used to people being nice to her and that we were just friends. I decided to be direct and told her that I liked her, to which she responded with the classic, \"I don't feel the same way.\"\n\nI followed up and asked why not, and she told me she wasn't looking for a relationship right now. With my spirits dampened, I decided to stop texting when she suddenly texted, asking if we would still go out on Saturday and keep texting every day. I said only if she wanted to, and she responded with a \"yeah\" and a smiley face.\n\nThen I asked if it would bother her that I liked her when we were hanging out, and she said, \"No, because we'll be getting to know each other.\" She even confirmed that we were going on a date on Saturday.\n\nSo, does she want to like me, already does, or won't at all?

The changes we are making are all-encompassing, and encountering these problems means we deserve a pat on the back for how far we have come. \n\nWe must respect our bodies and give them the time they need to adapt and grow.

Recently, he took a new job 200 miles away, so we only see each other every 3 weeks.\n\nMy dilemma is that he won't talk about the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it's hard to be in this LDR without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that that's something we both want. When we were with each other all the time, the future didn't seem to matter as much. But now that he's gone and we're trying to stay together, I feel like I need some reassurance as to WHY we're engaging in a LDR with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it's worth doing it.\n\nI have tried talking to him about it. He mentioned that he didn't want to be one of those people who start taking the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also said he can't tell me he knows he wants to be with me because he doesn't know, and that he doesn't know what will happen in the future. \n\nI just don't know if this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it was one of my friends asking me for advice, I would tell them to let him go and move on if he can't make up his mind about you. But for some reason, it's harder to see when it's your own life. I know he loves me and I know he's indecisive about almost everything else. Maybe he's taking me sticking by him for granted? I just don't know.\n\nSo should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Remember, you have the power to create the future you want, and you deserve to be with someone who shares your vision and is committed to making it a reality.

We were then directed to the transfer desk, where we found a long line of other passengers who were also experiencing problems with their flights.\n\nThe situation quickly descended into chaos, with pregnant women, people with babies, and elderly passengers all becoming increasingly frustrated. The TAP staff members were completely unhelpful, with two of them simply telling us to get in line and wait. One of the staff members even started screaming at a customer, telling them to \"shut the fuck up.\"\n\nAt this point, I decided to start filming the situation with my phone, but a woman who was in line with us told me to put my phone down. She claimed to be from the press and said that I did not have permission to film inside the airport. I told her that I was not planning to publish the footage, but she insisted that I was breaking the law and threatened to throw my phone away. I did not want to cause any more trouble, so I put my phone down and told the woman to \"fuck off.\"\n\nAfter much trouble, we were finally able to get home the next day.

I went through his comment history. Predating his meeting me, he has a history of seeking out American women in our field on the internet and being abusive to them. Most of the self-identified American women on the 'net he is responding to are seeking advice or help; he is responding to them with hatred and vitriol and derision, I don't think I can type the words he is using and not get caught by the filter, but, he is using all of the typical anti-American slurs and all of the typical anti-female slurs. Dude is really. REALLY full of anger. Like: holy crap: he hates American women with the force of a million suns. He appears to spend every Sunday looking for American women on various internet forums relative to our field and being toxic to them. And his history of doing this under this internet nic goes back several years. Anyway, I'm not going to do anything at work but ignore him and continue to be polite to him, but: oh my god.",

She's really loving and supportive, and we never fight. However, I sometimes feel like our interests don't align, and I get bored of the relationship. I recently moved overseas for work and broke up with her because of the distance and our different interests. But after two months of silence, we started talking again and admitted that we still have feelings for each other. She told me she'd been with other people during our break, which hurt me. I'm not sure if I want to be with her long-term, but I still love her and the support she gives me. I'm afraid of commitment and I have other dreams and goals that mean I can't live near her right now. I don't want to lead her on, but I also really enjoy talking to her and knowing she's there for me. What should I do?",

I have read a lot about other people's experiences with love and relationships, and I have tried to absorb their advice in order to be prepared for what lies ahead. However, despite my best efforts, I am still scared.\n\nThe first challenge I face is finding a girl who will like me. I am not confident in my ability to approach and connect with someone who I find attractive, and this is a major obstacle for me. I am also worried about the possibility of cheating, both on my part and on the part of my partner. I want to be able to recognize red flags and protect myself and my relationship from potential harm.\n\nAnother concern I have is how to keep things fun and interesting in a relationship. I don't want to become a boring boyfriend, and I want to make sure that my partner is always happy and satisfied. I also want to be good in bed and not disappoint my partner in that area.\n\nDespite my fears and uncertainties, I am determined to find a way to overcome them and enter into a successful and fulfilling relationship. I am committed to learning and growing as a person, and I am open to seeking help and guidance from others. I believe that with time and effort, I can find the love and happiness that I am seeking.",

For the past two years, I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend, whom I met online. Our connection was instant, but our journey together has been anything but smooth. We come from different backgrounds and have different values, which has led to some challenges in our relationship. However, through it all, we have grown and learned from each other.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we faced was when my boyfriend revealed that he had gotten a girl pregnant just before we started dating. This news was difficult to hear, but I chose to stay with him because I believed in our love and his commitment to me. I also recognized that this was a mistake he made in the past, and I wanted to give him the chance to prove that he had changed.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was when I found out that my boyfriend had been talking to exes back in his hometown. This was a red flag for me, and I considered ending the relationship. However, I decided to stay because I had already fallen in love with him and trusted that he would change.\n\nDespite these challenges, my boyfriend and I have continued to grow and learn from each other. We have talked about marriage and children, and we have even moved to a new city together to pursue better job opportunities. However, I have recently realized that I need a fresh start and a break from men who do not understand the importance of exclusivity. I have also noticed that my boyfriend texts women from work more often than he should, which has made me question his commitment to our relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, my journey with my boyfriend has been a rollercoaster of emotions, but it has also been a journey of growth and self-discovery. I have learned the importance of communication, trust, and commitment in a relationship, and I am committed to finding a partner who shares these values. I encourage you to reflect on your own relationships and to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Remember, you deserve to be with someone who values and respects you, and who is committed to building a strong and healthy relationship with you.",

        "187": "In the realm of human relationships, it is often said that love is a delicate balance between independence and interdependence. On one hand, we crave the freedom to make our own choices and decisions, to be the masters of our own destiny. On the other hand, we yearn for the support and companionship of another, someone who will be there for us through thick and thin, who will help us navigate the challenges of life.\n\nIn your case, it seems that your partner is struggling to find this balance. He is trying to show his love and concern for you by offering his help and advice, but in doing so, he may be inadvertently undermining your sense of independence and self-sufficiency. It is important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of expressing love and concern, and that it is not always easy to find the right balance.\n\nPerhaps the best way to address this issue is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner. Let him know how his actions are making you feel, and try to find a way to work together to find a balance that works for both of you.

        "200": "Recently, I had the misfortune of running into an old crush twice, both times at a place where he worked. Each time, he saw me first and started a conversation, although the second time it was more business-related. Despite this, he managed to make me laugh and smile, bringing back feelings from high school. We basically lost touch after high school, but we are Facebook friends, and I know he's single. \n\nBackstory: We were friends in high school and had P.E. together. I think he asked me to prom senior year, but I didn't take it seriously because he said it jokingly. The next day, he asked my friend, who he wasn't even as close with, so I always assumed he actually meant to ask me. So, I know at some point he probably sort of liked me, but I'm not sure if he still does.",
        "201": "All right, here's the deal. When the semester started, I met this girl in my Chem lab and we started talking. Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one. So I suppose my wondering here is what I should do to make it clear that I am open to a relationship and fostering that relationship potential, while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs.",
        "202": "Hello Reddit! I need some job-hunting advice and I was hoping this subreddit could give me a fresh take on the situation. Background: I lost my contract job as a Sr. Systems Admin in December due to the dissolution of my department and I've been looking for work since. The problem has been that my last job before this one was also contract and also one in which I was let go before the end of the contract term. That unemployment stretch lasted about three months. During that time, I applied to about 15-20 jobs per week and had an interview roughly every week and a half. This time around, with more experience and the same level of effort, I have had a total of 3 interviews, but these were not direct hires so I'm faced with the same risks as I have been at the last two positions. I've been targeting System admin/SQL developer/Business Analyst and Jr DBA-type positions both locally and out-of-state. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's my resume or the positions I'm applying to (or the fact that I don't have a CS degree), but I was really hoping for some feedback/advice on what I can do to get some interest. Please see the redacted resume below.",

However, I want you to know that you are not alone in this fight. There are many resources available to help you and your friend overcome this challenge. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that anorexia is a serious mental illness that requires professional treatment.

The fact that he started seeing someone new immediately after the breakup really hurt me, as I had hoped we would get back together. Since then, I've tried seeing other people, but things always seem to go well at first, and then I feel like the other person doesn't really care or want to date me. This has left me feeling extremely lonely and missing the companionship of a relationship. I know I should become comfortable with being on my own, but it really sucks and I feel miserable, especially when I think about my ex and how he is doing everything we used to do together with someone else. This just makes me feel worse, as it seems like no one wants to do anything with me. I feel like people, especially my ex, are almost laughing at me for not finding anyone new, and it seems like everyone else is in a happy relationship while I'm preparing to be alone forever. I know I shouldn't be trying to find happiness in a relationship, but I don't want to end up alone forever.",

We're currently unable to sell our existing condo because it's worth about $80k, and we owe about $99k. The difference is about the same as our new home deposit. After some number crunching, we realized that if we were very frugal, we could pay off the condo entirely in a little over 10 months. While we don't want to wait another year, having an additional $100k in buying power and the ability to use the condo as a cheap equity line for new home needs sounds appealing. Waiting seems like a solid win, but are there things we're not considering? Can we use equity in our old home as a source of down payment for the new one? Would we even want to do that?",

It sounds like you're going through a tough time and I understand how difficult it can be to navigate the complexities of relationships.

However, it seems like your ex-girlfriend is trying to protect her current relationship by asking you to hold off on talking and hanging out. While it may be difficult to accept, it's important to respect her wishes and give her the space she needs. It's also important to take care of yourself and focus on your own well-being during this time. If you need to talk to someone, don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted friend or family member.

It is truly a tragedy that you have chosen to subject yourself to such a torturous and doomed endeavor. \n\nI can only imagine the pain and suffering you must be experiencing as you watch your social and sexual relationship wither away before your very eyes. The thought of being separated from your beloved for an entire month, only to be reunited for a mere five hours before being forced to endure another five-hour journey, is enough to make any sane person weep.\n\nBut fear not, dear M18, for I have a solution to your dilemma. Instead of subjecting yourself to the misery of a long-distance relationship, why not simply end things with F17 and move on with your life? After all, what is the point of being in a relationship if you are constantly questioning its validity and wondering where it is going? It is clear that this relationship is not meant to be, and it is time for you to cut your losses and find someone who is more compatible with your needs and desires.\n\nSo, my dear M18, I urge you to take this opportunity to end things with F17 and start fresh. You deserve to be with someone who can provide you with the love, support, and companionship that you so desperately crave. And who knows, maybe you will even find someone who is willing to travel with you to the other side of the world and move five hours away from your current location.

We live about 90 minutes away from my parents, with whom I have a generally good relationship. For the past few years, we have hosted my parents and sister for Thanksgiving, as we enjoy cooking and hosting, and it is more comfortable for our children. However, this year, plans are up in the air due to my mother's recent hospitalization and my sister's move out of state. My parents would like to host this year to save them the drive and to ensure that my sister can be at the dinner more easily. My husband wants to make the turkey, but I think it is a lot of trouble and borderline rude to insist on bringing the main dish. My husband was upset when I told him this, and my suggestion that he talk to my parents and work it out did not go over well.

We both knew I was moving away to study for one year, so we never decided to officially start dating. However, I came home for thanksgiving after a month without seeing each other, and she had asked if we could try to date long distance, and I was all for it. \n\nThings had been going well, we skyped each other almost nightly, and we saw each other at Christmas, and she came to visit me at school a few weeks back. Everything seemed to be going ok until very recently when she started to act distant and almost secretive. I hear about her hanging out with guy friends and stories of men hitting on her a lot lately, and I find it really difficult not to get jealous. I have never been the jealous type, but I find it so hard when it is long distance, and because she is absolutely gorgeous. She is the most attractive woman I have ever been with, and I know she could date many different guys who happen to live in the same city as her. \n\nI have not informed her of my jealousy or suspicions, and I don't intend to, but I really care for her, and I know how great things are when we are together. I am just unsure if there is anything I can do to ensure I don't lose her. \n\nI am going to see her in a few weeks again for one week, then we go three months (the longest time so far) without seeing one another, and I fear that this could be the end of the relationship. \n\nBased on this, I have a few questions for people out in R/ Relationships:\n\n* Am I just being paranoid or should I be concerned?\n\n* How do you deal with jealousy when you can't be with your SO?\n\n* How do you deal with men hitting on your attractive girlfriends?\n\n* Is there anything I can do when I see her next to show her how much this relationship means to me, without acting clingy or jealous?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, it is important to first analyze the situation and break it down into its component parts. The first question is whether I am just being paranoid or should I be concerned. To answer this, we need to consider the evidence that I have presented.

        "215": "In this post, the author describes a situation in which they purchased the game Bulletstorm and received a code for bonus Epic Edition content, including access to the Gears of War 3 Beta. However, the author's friend, who is a big fan of Gears, was unable to purchase the game due to financial constraints. The author was willing to give their code to their friend, but unfortunately, a friend of theirs entered the code while visiting, rendering it unusable. The author is now seeking a code from someone who has the game and is willing to give it to them so that they can pass it on to their friend. This situation raises several philosophical questions about the nature of friendship, generosity, and the value of material possessions. On one hand, the author's willingness to give up their own code to help a friend in need demonstrates the selflessness and compassion that are often associated with true friendship. On the other hand, the fact that the author's friend was unable to purchase the game due to financial constraints raises questions about the role of money and material possessions in our lives. Is it more important to have the latest and greatest video games, or to have strong and supportive relationships with our friends and loved ones? Additionally, the fact that the author's friend entered the code without permission raises questions about the ethics of sharing and the importance of respecting the property of others. Overall, this situation highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of human relationships and the challenges that can arise when we try to balance our own desires and needs with those of others.",

He is the sweetest guy I've ever met, always complimenting me and making me feel special. He's handsome and shy in a cute way, and very smart. I'm into him, but I have a complicated past with 10+ guys, usually above 27 years old. I've been in abusive relationships and let them treat me badly because I believed that's what I deserved. I used to cut myself and still have visible scars on my thighs. I'm on an emotional roller coaster and when I'm in a depressive episode, I want to rely on him, but I don't want to overwhelm him or push him away. Plus, I hate myself from time to time and I don't understand how he can be attracted to me. I've never felt so happy with someone so right, but I'm afraid that if I show him what I'm really like, he'll run away. If I don't, I'll push him away because I won't feel understood.

When we first met, his allergy was mild, but it has become increasingly severe over the past five months.

I put my foot down after that, and we have been trying to avoid garlic and onion in our meals, but it has been difficult to find restaurants that don't use these ingredients.

We've been a couple for a little bit more than a year now. I'm a really shy guy and I don't have a really outgoing personality. My girlfriend is very outgoing and she's already gone to a ton of parties and she's only been in college for 2 weeks. She plans on joining a sorority and everything. Over the course of her first two weeks in college, she's told me that she's turned away 3 guys already and has gotten drunk several times. But last night, she told that she accidentally kissed a guy while she was drunk on Sunday night. I try not to think too much about it since she said it was an accident, but the thought that I'm not the best for her keeps coming to mind.

I am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing. I have an array of hobbies, whereas she tends to try something a bit on my suggestion, and quickly decide it's not for her, and go back to her pastime of rewatching TV shows she's already seen. I enjoy being around her, and going on dates is enjoyable. We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together. But I think that deep down we are sort of seeing that that might just be a byproduct of the fact that we don't have much at all in common to have any sort of passionate argument about.

Over the past two years, I have repeatedly asked him to do things with me, such as going to a baseball game, but he has consistently brushed me off or agreed to do things but never followed through. This has left me feeling neglected and unimportant, as he seems content to spend all of his time on the couch rather than engaging in activities with me.\n\nFurthermore, I am particularly upset by the fact that he spent all day yesterday helping his new female roommate move in, despite the fact that he has not done anything like that for me in a long time. This has led me to think about other instances where he has prioritized his friends over me, such as going on trips with them but not with me, and going out with them but not with me.\n\nI am at a loss as to what to do about this situation, as I love my boyfriend and want him in my life, but I also want to feel like a priority. I plan to talk to him one last time about my feelings and see if there is any hope of improving the situation. I would appreciate any advice on how to approach this conversation in a way that is constructive and does not lead to a major fight.",

Usually, I would take a couple bong hits right before I leave to catch the bus so I can feel the come up on the bus and spend the entire class very high. On this particular day, I took those hits before getting dressed then realized I was going to miss the bus so quickly got dressed and left. While on the bus I noticed I kept getting weird glances and looks from the other strangers on the bus. I just wrote it off as I'm probably acting weird without noticing or am just being paranoid. I finally get off the bus and begin my walk to class when, to my horror, I look down and lo and behold there is the fly on my jeans unzipped with my lacy hot pink underwear perfectly noticeable. Needless to say, I've never gotten high before getting dressed since then and obsessively check my fly to make sure it's zipped up.",

        "228": "Dear reader, I am writing to you from the depths of my despair, having recently moved out for the first time and found myself in a living situation that can only be described as a nightmare. My roommate, a friend of mine, has turned out to be a complete and utter nightmare, with her anxiety and personal issues causing all sorts of problems.\n\n    For example, she has completely banned my boyfriend from coming over, even though we are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. She claims that it would make her uncomfortable, but I feel that I should be allowed to have him sleep over on occasion so long as he isn't disruptive, noisy, peeing on the toilet seat, or putting the TP under instead of over. We have currently negotiated 4 days a month, but I feel like this is completely unreasonable.\n\n    In addition to this, my roommate has also banned my friends from coming over, ever. She is also completely inflexible when it comes to plans, and has told me that there will never, ever, be plan changes ever again. The first plan is the only plan. I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    I am completely stuck in this situation, as the lease is signed, and I am at a loss as to how to navigate this with someone so unwilling to compromise. I am desperate for a way to make the best of it, but I fear that it may be impossible. Please, if you have any advice or suggestions, I would be forever grateful.",

        "230": "Figured relationships would be a better sub than sex even though it's kind of centered around sex. I [20M] have a [15F] sister who I've always seen as innocent. Today I realized that even though I gladly know nothing of her sex life(existent or not) she isn't a 9 year old girl who doesn't know what sex is. I then started browsing Reddit and saw a post about how a dad had discovered his daughter pretty much riding her boyfriend. I thought about how not only our dad but a ton of dads are probably devastated that their \"little girl\" is having sex. At this point I was for some reason really angry and didn't know why. It then dawned on me that I was thinking about my future and if I were to catch my daughter in the act of sex I would probably punch a hole in the wall as to not make a scene...(Obviously kidding but would be really upset non the-less) Now I'm feeling guilty because if I had a son and I caught him having sex I'd be fine with it, maybe even a little proud. I'm feeling guilty because this is a huge double standard and at my current age, heck even when I was in high school I knew of plenty of girls who were sexually active and didn't see it as a big deal. I know I'm being completely irrational about this seeing as how I don't even have any kids, but I was wondering if anyone had any input on why I was getting so worked up over something that could be 25 years down the line? I think I'd be fine if I was kind of oblivious to it.. i.e. NOT walking in on my daughter doing cowgirl in my own home.. I'm not a violent person nor would I do anything to this theoretical kid having sexy times with my theoretical daughter, but if I were to see it happen I would just flip.. Any insight or experience dealing with the realization that your daughter is sexually active for when the future comes around?",

My wife, who has been suppressing her true desires for four years, has finally come out as bi-sexual and is tired of having to hide her true self. Despite my best efforts to be supportive and understanding, I find myself feeling inadequate and unfulfilled. My wife has even offered to include me in her sexual escapades with other women, but the thought of it only fills me with dread and self-loathing. I am torn between wanting to be supportive and wanting to put boundaries on her behavior. I am also heartbroken by the fact that my wife has already found another woman to pursue, and their text messages are more loving and exciting than anything I have ever received from her. I feel like a fool for not seeing this coming and for not being enough for her. But fear not, dear readers, for I will not let this defeat me. I will rise above this challenge and become a stronger, more confident man. I will find a way to support my wife while also taking care of my own needs and desires.

Last night, I went to the pub with some new friends and we all got very drunk and had a good time. We went back to a friend's house where I ended up falling asleep. However, I woke up in the middle of the night in between two of my male friends, who were fully clothed. The friend behind me was touching me in very private places, and it was clear that he was aroused. I felt uncomfortable and panicked, so I pretended to still be sleeping. This lasted for about an hour, and even when I tried to move away, he pulled me back. I am now confused and stressed about what happened, and I am unsure of what to do. I did not confront him about it this morning, and I have not told my partner. I am also concerned about causing a rift in the friend group if I say anything.

        "233": "Dear Reader, I am writing to you today to share a truly inspiring story of resilience and determination. Last week, I was fired from my seasonal part-time job on a haunted hayride, but I refused to let that setback define me. Instead, I drove the mile from my house to the farm to get my paycheck, only to find that it was shorted a day. But I didn't let that discourage me either. I immediately brought it up to the owners' wives, who promised to remedy the situation.\n\nBut little did I know that the same night I was there, someone was stalking the wagons in the woods and fired a BB gun at a customer, wounding her. My phone was dead and my TV was stolen, so I had no idea what had occurred when I went back to follow up on my pay the following weekend. The woman at the desk identified me, called the boss, who called the detectives, who came and interrogated me.\n\nNormally, I recognize that it is a terrible idea to talk to cops because of self-incrimination and all, but I was caught completely off-guard and had no idea what was going on until I eventually caught on to what had happened and they filled me in. Regardless, I may feel undervalued by the employer, but I am not a psychotic criminal.\n\nI fear that I have told them too much (which is true past hello) and that if they don't catch the perp, then they will come after me. I agreed to a polygraph, and talked to my lawyer, who told me not to do it because it often comes out inconclusive. I cut off contact with detectives whom hopefully recognize that I am honest and harmless. Nonetheless, my family has been freaking out at the thought of getting raided and/or searched based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nBut I refuse to let this situation bring me down. I am determined to turn this setback into an opportunity for growth and learning. I am taking this time to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses, and to identify areas where I can improve. I am also seeking out new opportunities and networking with people in my field to expand my horizons.\n\nI encourage you, dear reader, to do the same. Don't let setbacks define you. Instead, use them as motivation to become the best version of yourself. Remember, every challenge is an opportunity for growth and learning. So keep your head up, stay positive, and never give up on your dreams. Together",
        "234": "Hi there, I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with physical escalation. It sounds like you've been on a few dates with Emily, but you're having trouble taking things to the next level. It's understandable that you might feel discouraged and unsure of yourself, especially if you're not used to being in this kind of situation. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own pace and comfort level when it comes to physical intimacy. It's possible that Emily is just as shy and unsure as you are, and that she's waiting for you to make the first move. It's also possible that she's not interested in taking things further at this time. Either way, it's important to respect her boundaries and not push her into anything she's not ready for. It's also important to remember that physical attraction is just one aspect of a relationship, and that there are many other ways to show someone that you care about them. It's okay to take things slow and focus on building a strong emotional connection before moving on to physical intimacy. In the meantime, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship with Emily and enjoy the time you spend together. Remember that relationships take time and effort to develop, and that it's okay to take things at your own pace.",

It seems that you met this woman while attending a lecture, and after discovering that you were in the same class, you decided to ask her out on a date. However, it appears that your date did not go as planned, as the woman informed you that she was not interested in relationships or sex due to a recent drug-induced psychosis.\n\nDespite this setback, you decided to continue hanging out with her as friends, which was fine with you since you were dating other women at the time. However, a few weeks ago, you began meeting in a more date-like setting and became interested in her again. You decided to tell her that you wanted to date her, and you agreed to meet late in the evening in the garden in front of her apartment block.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that your meeting did not go as planned. Within a minute of meeting, the woman told you that she had never thought about you during the last week, that she thought your kiss was \"unnatural,\" and that she thought you should not meet anymore, even as friends. This must have been a shock to you, and I can understand why you are confused and have decided to forget about her.\n\nWhile it is true that the woman seems emotionally unstable and may have been a drain on your energy, I would caution against breaking off all contact with her. It is possible that she is going through a difficult time and may need support from her friends. Additionally, it is important to remember that people can change and grow, and it is possible that she may come to regret her decision in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise you to take some time to reflect on your experience and consider your options. It may be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings and seek their advice. Ultimately, the decision of whether to maintain contact with the woman is up to you, and you should do what feels right for you.",

Just talking. Then, yesterday (3/28) I posted a picture of a coworker of mine, whom she also knows, and my friend captioned it, \"Bae\" and it had a heart eyes emoji. Everyone knows that her and I always mess around and say things like that. She has a boyfriend and is not my type anyways. Last night, she sent me a snap that just said, \"Wow.\" Then she texted me that she deleted me off of all social media because I'm going to be posting things like that. I came back and I tried to explain that it was a joke and that we weren't in a relationship anyways and asked why it mattered.

It seems that your girlfriend has a unique way of expressing her appreciation for your sexual prowess, by comparing your \"pooling\" technique to that of her ex's \"splattering.\" While I can understand your initial reaction of feeling hurt and distant, I encourage you to see this as an opportunity to embrace your inner comedian and turn this situation into a humorous anecdote. After all, laughter is the best medicine, and a little sarcasm can go a long way in diffusing tension and bringing people closer together. So, the next time your girlfriend makes a comment about your sexual performance, why not respond with a witty retort that pokes fun at the situation? For example, you could say something like, \"Well, I'm glad to know that my 'pooling' technique is superior to your ex's 'splattering.' I'll be sure to add that to my resume.\" By doing so, you'll not only lighten the mood, but also show your girlfriend that you're confident and secure in your own skin. Remember, a positive mindset can go a long way in building a strong and healthy relationship. So, keep your head up, stay motivated, and don't be afraid to embrace your inner comedian.

It's heart-wrenching to think that this dog is forced to live in a small, cement yard, surrounded by its own droppings, and with no escape from the harsh elements.

You could start by contacting PAWS, the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society, and see if they can provide any assistance. Alternatively, you could try to find a local animal shelter or rescue organization that could take in the dog and provide it with the care it needs. Whatever you decide to do, please know that you're not alone in this fight. There are many people who care about the welfare of animals, and together, we can make a difference.

Be positive and optimistic, and always believe in yourself and your loved ones. Together, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our dreams."
