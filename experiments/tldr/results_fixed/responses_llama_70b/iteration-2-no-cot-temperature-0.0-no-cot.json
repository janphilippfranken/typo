        "0": "POST: This is my first post so please be kind :)\n\nI know that lots of people often feel confused when they come out of a long-term relationship. They think they have forgotten how to be single, or how to flirt/date.\n\nI am one of these people.\n\nThe problem is, my relationship started when I had just turned 16. I have never been single - as an adult. That might sound silly. But the only time I have ever flirted or dated was as an over-confident, hormone-riddled teenager.\n\nNow I have a pretty demanding job, responsibilities blah blah... And I just don't know how to this!\n\nI'm no way in a rush to get into a new relationship, but that doesn't mean I want to be completely alone in the mean time.\n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar, or just generally has some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",
        "1": "POST: (Full background under my submitted)\n\nI decided I couldn't wait for my ex to come around since there was no guarantee that me waiting for her would be worth it. Sure since the breakup we hadn't talked as much obviously but now that we are done seemingly forever I can't comprehend at all knowing that we will never laugh, kiss, talk etc etc together ever again. \n\nWe had so many plans and so much love but now all that is gone. How do I coupe with that? How can I move on and be happy after knowing all the hard work we put in and all the love is out the door now. I just can't wrap my head around knowing that the girl I thought I would marry will now move on and live her life away from me till the day we both die.  \n\nI still do care for her, yes I still love her even after everything that happened at the end. I feel so alone and lost even though the actual break up was months ago, I'm honestly just afraid of the future now.",
        "2": "POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 7 months now, and it has been a blast since the very first day. We basically went from rather good friends to an amazing couple without any awkwardness or friendzone-y (?) problems. Because of this, we are both pretty much convinced that we have found \"the one\".\n\nHowever, I recently learned that she is rather envious of my past girlfriends, my last ex in particular. As far as I can tell, her main concern is that I have been intimate in the same ways with them as I have been with her. She can't quite seem to grasp the idea that with her, everything is very much different. Sexual acts are much more meaningful, if that makes any sense, than they were before. \n\nAdditionally, she has a hard time processing the idea that I, at some point, loved and cared for them too in the same way as I care for her now. I tend to be a little \"overly-attached\" at times, so I can't really object to this statement. It is not entirely impossible that I care for her the way I do simply because it's in my nature.\n\nHowever, I am positive that I have never been in love with anyone as I have been with my current girlfriend, and wouldn't want it all to end because of this. I have consoled her the best I could, but I'd rather keep it from you redditors. This way, it might be easier to come up with an objective advice.",

While this is a great accomplishment I have noticed a significant spike in my sex drive during the week leading up to the race and in the days since I ran; about 10 days in total.\nI workout 2-3 times per week for about 45 minutes each time and have average eating habits. During the week leading up to the race, I ate mostly a plant-based diet - salad for lunch and dinner, fish for protein, etc. - and worked out 3 times and ran only twice (Not great prep, I know.) This helped me lose about 2 or 3 pounds.\nNow, I cannot stop thinking about sex! This morning (Thursday) I spent about 3 hours watching porn and \"distracted\" myself by going to a midday fitness class. Now I want to jerk off again or have find someone to sex.\nI don't know what to do. This is both embarrassing and confusing. I want to continue working out but am honestly afraid being fit will turn me into a sex addict.\nBackground: I played soccer in college and recall a similar correlation during my off season workouts. I am now in my late 20s and no longer train 5-6 days a week as was the norm in college. This is the most physically active I have been since my early 20s.\nQuestion: Is there research that has connected a higher sex drive (thinking more about sex) with a increased physical activity (working out)? Also, share your experiences because I feel like an outlier here.",

They're all fairly cute but I've been burned once by internet relationships and I wasn't really looking for another\n\nWell... I got drunk and told one of the girls that I thought she was really cute but that I \"didn't mean anything serious about it.\"\n\nI woke up in the morning and realized what I'd done and apologized and her exact words were \"no no, it's always nice to know somebody thinks you look nice :)\"\n\nI feel awful about it and I feel like a creep but I feel like apologizing further would just make it weirder. We haven't spoken since and I don't have many friends (even very casual ones like this one) and it just makes me feel worse that I think I accidentally fucked one up I think.\n\nI can include the exact messages exchanged if need be.",

Because of this, and several other things, I became quite depressed and our relationship suffered for it, and it eventually led to us breaking up. One of the main reasons him giving is that i was too negative and he couldn't deal with my depression as well as his stress, which I can understand.  \n\nAlthough i can see that the relationship wasn't right for me, I just cant get past that initial stage of heartbreak.  I have just been a complete mess for the past few weeks, cant sleep, cant eat, I cant do anything.  Having read all the articles about how to get over a relationship, I'm trying to follow them, but things are made difficult by the fact that a lot of my friends have moved away from my home town, there isn't much to do in the way of hobbies around here (I live in a small Welsh village), and most of the friends that I made in the past three years are mutual with my ex so it is difficult to visit and attend social events without seeing him.  I just feel really lonely.  I just dont know how to get out of this slump that I'm in.  I know people say that you have to go through the pain, but I feel unless I do something, I will never get through it.  \n\nHow have you gotten over the initial stages of heartbreak reddit?

        "6": "POST: It's summer and I've got a lot of time on my hands, I've also got some fat accumulating on my body that I really wouldn't like to be there and have a new appearance when I return to school in August. I'm a gamer so my diet is poor and I tend to sit around a lot. I've already got my diet on the way to a greener future so that is covered but thoughts are still welcome on that. I'd like to stay away from going to the gym if possible, my ultimate goal is to be thinner and look like I'm in good shape but I don't want to build a lot of muscle, so mostly cardio work I was thinking. I thought a morning jog that would go progressively further everyday would be a start but I'm unsure as I've never tried to lose weight before, doing this in the morning to me would also rid me of my laziness by forcing me to be active first thing in the morning. So anybody else that has advice or tips it'd be appreciated.",
        "7": "POST: We began dating right after 1st year Uni, dated 1 year then broke up for 6 months over differences in expectations for how long our dating would continue before marriage.\nI lean toward a shorter dating preference (1.5-3yrs) by which point I feel I would have decided on way or the other. She feels more that every other aspect of her life (career, school, family, financials...) must be perfectly in place to accommodate marriage regardless of how long that takes. \n\nAfter getting back together and being more clear that I would be willing to date happily until she felt her life was in order if she was considerate of me not wanting to date just to hold off marriage. and things have been going relatively well since then (3+ years since). We have travelled together, spent family holidays together and always been in open communication about our motivations, opinions, aspirations and disagreements. We have not lived together.\n\nSince 1-2 months ago we have been slowly having more and more difficulty with our depth/frequency of conversation and it is making her very uncertain about our relationships future and how much I care for her.\nI am someone who is very easygoing, patient, I feel loved by just spending quality time (out of the house especially) together a few times per week and doing random acts of kindness. I would only expect to have a thought provoking and deep conversation with my closest friends and family perhaps 1 time per month, and somewhat more with my SO.\nShe is someone who is very critical thinking, loves hugs and being complimented, and is always excited to just sit and talk about anything that comes to mind for a long time as long as the conversation is stimulating.\n\nIt does not, to me, feel like we've been having fewer conversations but she tells me I have been less ready to participate actively and less giving of my time for such conversations. I feel that such an intense level of conversation just isn't sustainable, she feels it's necessary. We plan to attend couples counselling this month for the first time.\n\nIs this normal? Is it a real problem or is one of us being unreasonable? Can anyone relate? I really do love her and want this to work.",
        "8": "POST: Obligatory this was when I was in high school. \n\nSo, for those of you who don't know, in Boston there's a shopping area called Haymarket. To all the tourists in the area, it's just Faneuil Hall, which is the crazy cramped food court building in the center of the area. You can get all kinds of foods there, ranging from Irish pub to mediocre Chinese food to sushi to Gelato. My personal favorite is currently the mac and cheese shop, but that's not the point.\n\nWhen I was in high school and come into Boston on my own, I would always make a bee line to the Greek shop in Faneuil Hall. During my first time there, I noticed the food item called \"tzatziki - a kind of Greek yogurt.\" Coming from East Bumfuck, NH, I didn't know much about many other cultures' food stuffs, but I certainly knew about Greek yogurt!\n\nI don't know why I choose this, because I hated yogurt at the time (\"it has live bacteria in it!\" I can't explain the logic in that argument if I tried,) but I decided to order it. The people at the counter looked at me and were like, \"Okay, tzatziki aaaaaand?\" And then I cheerfully replied with, \"Oh, and a Nantucket Nectar!\"\n\nThey just looked at me, reached into the display case, and slid the solid near-2 cup tub of tzatziki over to me. I bounced up and down in excitement, gave them some money (and told them to keep the change! I'm a good person!) And bounced upstairs to eat lunch with a spoon. It tasted great, but after like five or more bites it caused that reaction where your body is just like, \"Okay, you need to cool it with that stuff.\"\n\nI proceeded to order tzatziki every time I went to Faneuil Hall for a solid year. I couldn't figure out why everyone around me looked at me with mild disgust/bewilderment. Until I looked at the ingredient list for an online recipe for tzatziki.",
        "9": "POST: Okay... Long story short.\n\nMy wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. \n\nWe went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $320 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any. At this point I am wondering if it is even worth it to have a job because even though I would lose my part time income of 29k we could save 12k per year in day care costs and who knows, maybe get free health care (this of course really isn't an option)\n\nI would like to know if there is some sort of advocacy service that can help me navigate the insurance system so that I can get my family affordable insurance without paying over 15% of our annual  income.\n\nSorry if this comes across ranty but i just get discouraged when two people who try to plan, go to school, contribute to society, and stay employed end up getting shafted this hard when they simply want to get a pair of glasses and some back adjustments.",

I finally decided on the Forerunner 305 since it would do everything I wanted and was a good price (even though it's huge).\n\nBest price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I wanted to wait 1-2 weeks. It was available at the local Best Buy for $150. Did a quick search and found a printable coupon good for the month of February at Best Buy for 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products.\n\nWent in to Best Buy and the price was $160 on the shelf. I found an employee (just happened to be a cute girl) nearby and told her I wanted to get the 305. She said she had that model and loved it...even more than some of the more expensive ones she tried (even though it's huge). She said she has run some marathons and we chatted a little bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while waiting in line at the cashier. I definitely hope to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nSo I got to the cashier and the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned the web site price was $150 and he price matched it. Then I gave him the 20% off coupon and it wouldn't scan. He tried typing in the number and it wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. Super easy, out the door for $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (that's an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS.\n\nHere's a link to the coupon. Hopefully it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on 2/28/2011.",

I know I'm probably blind or something. >.<\n\nI read the FAQ, and I was able to do some of the things to get started but many of the things I am still confused on. I was able to calculate my BMR (By the way is there one calculator that is better than the others? I got a few different numbers.) However, when I went to the link on the FAQ to calculate my BF%, the page was gone. Is this necessary? However, I know even without my BF% that I would be classified as \"skinny fat\" at 5'9 and 156 pounds with a decent layer of fat.\n\nThe next part I am confused on is diet. Most of the provided resources provide diets to try don't seem like they would lend themselves well to everyday/lifetime eating. I don't know how to eat healthy. The last time I tried to truly get in good shape I did it all wrong. I'm talking eating only 800-900 calories a day, counting obsessively, cutting out all my favorite foods, and interspersed with bouts of binging on aforementioned foods. Today, counting calories freaks me out because I fear that I will go back to that. \n\nI am trying to get into real fitness, like going to a gym or bodyweight fitness, but I cannot afford a gym membership and I can't seem to find something study enough to use as a pullup bar for bodyweight. What are my other options because I do want to build muscle.\n\nMy final question is that I have no idea what I am truly aiming for. I want to lose my layer of fat and build muscle, but I am not sure if there's a goal weight involved or what sort of time table I am looking at or how many calories I would need to eat. This brings us full circle as I restate that I have no idea what I am doing.",

Like my feelings are annoying to him and bother him. I don't want to break up, but I hate always wondering if he doesn't reciprocate my affection because he doesn't love me. He has mentioned that in previous relationships he was cuddly and affectionate, but his ex girlfriends were cold and distant (according to him).",
        "34": "POST: Hey relationship redditors,\n\nI have a quick and intriguing question about relationships in college. What would you do in this situation? It is kind of awkward once I really think about it. Here's my short story. \n\nI'm 20 years old in college. In our college's honor program enjoying life and utilizing my brain to the highest capacity. I've met some really cool people over the couple years at my college. I wasn't too interested in girl's at first, however I am comfortable around them now. I wasn't before. I still am a little reserved, but that's all worked out now. I've changed up my lifestyle and negative habits and I'm in college to be a doctor! Only black man in my honors philosophy course and everyone else is white. Representing the black community! We need to represented in these sophisticated classes! XD\n\nAnyway, I knew this really nice girl from last semester. We met in the hall after a random instance. I don't know how we got to know each other, but anyway I really like talking to her. However, she told me that she's not too interested in doing anything out. Like going out. She's pretty comfy where she's at now and doesn't want to date. She told me that she liked me, but doesn't want to do that type of thing. It's pretty understandable.\n\nShe has a sister and I can sense that she really likes me! 0.o. It is a weird feeling, but all I do is politely bob my head to say hi and she really lights up when she sees me. And I ended up eating lunch with her. It was a really good meal and we have similar interests. She's a vegetarian and was on a cleanse and ate some really good looking salad! That alone was very admirable! Because I thought, \"wow that's exactly what I'd do!\" She kind of hinted and have me good vibes, but I could be wrong.",

I've known Mike for a few months now and like I said, gooey feely blah - I was going to ask him out. \n\nSo as we were driving to a restaurant for dinner, he tells me about his new roommate(let's say Joey). Joey and Mike go back to elementary school. Turns out, they dated in high school and when Joey's parents found out about his homosexuality, they took all of his communication (phone, facebook, email everything). Mike tells me that nobody's seen or heard from Joey in years and messaged him through a fake Facebook account and Joey is moving across the country to get away from parents, but in doing this he is moving in with Mike. \n\nSo I'm shocked at dinner and the rest of the drive as Mike also talks about the huge probability of them being together. I couldn't say anything about me so I left earlier than we planned. My fear is that they are getting together and I'll be left in the dust. (Prob'ly happening anyway) and I still have all these feels for Mike but I don't want to ruin our friendship or get in the way of this soap opera story. I feel like it's my last chance to tell him. Should I? Is it a good idea?",

We've been together for about 3 years. We've had a lot of ups and some downs. \nWhen we first met (before I was in LE) we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunks constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately he's been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am give or take in this bar district. He does this while I'm at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job... Getting cussed, thrown up on, working car accidents, DWIs ect. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I'm working my butt off overnight.  If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind. But it's several nights a week. \n\nI know my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying be there every single day but... Maybe shoot me a text or something atleast.  \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he's with or when he'll eventually go home so that adds to it.. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he's a grown ass man... But at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just over reacting?",

Thought it was just going to pass, but i liked her more and more, so i worked up the nerve to ask her for her number a while ago. We never really hang out or anything, but we always greeted each other and talked for a bit if we saw each other anywhere.\n\nI got the number, even though it seemed like she wasn't too interested when she gave me it. She made an excuse when i called her to meet up, so i just figured she's not interested, but i can't just forget her, i'm in deep, even hearing her voice when i called her is like a drug to me. \n\nShe studies in a city about an hour away at the moment, which i will be going to with my friend. It's not because of her, we're going just to go out and party there, it's the capital here.\n\nWhich brings me up to my question.\nDo you guys/girls think there is still a chance?

I was on the schedule to close and she was getting out in about 15 minutes. I went to the office to collect my tips and paychecks for the weeks past.

Our managers do not check schedules at all.  \n\nI collected my tips and checks and walked out. Knowing I left early enough for them to notice and make her stay until close.",

There are a couple issues: first, the physical distance between us and, second, her disproportionate feelings toward me. \n\nHer parents live about 20 minutes away from me so the distance wasn't a big deal for our first couple of dates. However, she is an undergraduate in a college that is 2.5 hours away from the city that I live/grad school that I attend.

It would be one thing if one of us wanted kids and the other didn't, but right now, both of us can't seem to come to a decision about kids. We have talked about it at length, and cannot come to some kind of final stance as to whether we want kids or not. \n\nIn some ways, we can picture ourselves as a family unit of two parents and one or two kids.

Long story short, I will not continue to live with him beyond 2 years.\n\nWe used to work together and I thought he had his act together. Little did I know it was all a front. He hardly leaves the apartment besides to go to work, never buys household goods, barely cleans up after himself, and definitely doesn't do his fair share of things around the apt.\n\nHe's generally a nice guy but he's completely oblivious and can be really inconsiderate. For example we used to smoke (weed) together from time to time. I am for the most part cool with it. Then it started turning into 12 hour smoke sessions where he would sit in his room all day smoking. I eventually asked him to stop smoking inside, but slowly he started to again. Finally one night, I had had enough and I called him out and he's taken to smoking outside.\n\nSo here's what happened. At the beginning of the month he told me a friend of his needed a place to stay for a few days. I obliged under the agreement that she wouldn't be in the apt all day (I'm working from home and interviewing, speaking on the phone with privileged information, financials, etc.)\n\nHere we are almost two weeks later. She's been here almost every day. The one day she wasn't here, he had his FWB staying the night.\n\nI'm incredibly annoyed at this point. I texted him yesterday (as I knew I wouldn't be home when he was.) Yet he never replied. I texted him again this AM and still crickets.\n\nMy friends say I'm more upset than I should be, but I think my anger is justified. It makes more work for me (constantly emptying the dishwasher, trash I only take out, lack of any kind of alone time in MY own apartment.) I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know I have to confront him but I feel like such a nag with these situations he puts me in. Any type of advice for confronting this would be really appreciated.",

They're a great group of people that I genuinely enjoy spending time with because they're good natured, funny, and we all support eachother when someone is going through a rough time.

He hasn't pulled when on the choke chain at all, even when it was first put on apparently, so we think that is what he was trained on (and damage from that process is probably why his barks and whines sound a bit odd). We now think the people who had him before us were violent towards him (if you mime kicking he runs across the room terrified), so, my question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearing a choke chain, and it isn't hurting him at all, but will the harm chokers and the people using them caused him in the past affect him in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on him and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with him pulling, and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it.

The company that is renting out the house I'm currently at is saying that since I'm moving out 'early' there won't be a new lease, and instead I'll be dropping from the current lease and declared 'vacating'.\n\nThat would be fine, since it's all the same to me, but they are asking me to sign a waiver saying the following:\n\n> \"Vacating Tenant agrees to relinquish all rights to any sums which Landlord may be holding on behalf of Vacating Tenant including but not limited to a security deposit, advance rent, any prepaid\n> fees or charges and agrees that nothing is owed to Vacating Tenant by the Landlord or its agent(s).\"\n\nI e-mailed the company and they say that the deposit cannot be withdrawn until everyone moves out.\n\nMy roommates are only living there for 6 more months and they are close friends, so I'm okay with dealing with this when they move out since it's only a few hundred dollars. I'm just worried about potential issues with the state of the house come that time and how much my deposit will be included in damages they do in the coming months.\nGetting the new guy (that's replacing me) to just give me the share of the deposit also doesn't exactly work, since we do not know how much of the deposit would be used in the current state of the house. When I move out it will be 2 years at that house.\n\nWhat should I do in this case?",

I've heard rumors that she is in an arranged marriage (Her family is Middle Eastern; Haven't confirmed this from her, as she is private and most likely wouldn't want to say anything on the matter)\n\n2. We have a few months left before she goes back home for a couple months and then will be going off to college (I'm only a Junior), and I most likely won't see her ever again unless we end up going to the same college 2 years from now, which does seem likely as we plan on going to the same school. \n\n3.

I sucked it up and accepted her apology and have been dealing with it ever since. This is about the time I registered her phone with the Find My Iphone service.\nFast forward to Monday night- I get texts form her saying she was going out to pick us up some food. I come home from work late around 7pm and she is not home. she wont answer my calls or texts. I know where she is cause I pulled up Find My Iphone website and she is at the local bar down the street. I wait for 3 hours and finally get a text of her saying she was at her girlfriends house and she will be home soon. LIAR! I had enough and stormed off to confront her at the bar. Didn't see the car she was driving in the parking lot so I'm starting to think im wrong, But there it is parked IN THE BACK. as if to hide from me.\nI found her and a guy she works with (restaurant, typical for sleeping with coworkers).\nNow we are a mess and Im about to throw her out and start my life over, Sucks cause I wanted to marry this one.\nShe doesn't know I tracked her with the iPhone. And I don't think Ill ever trust her again. Is it still cheating even though I didn't catch them having sex?

I am his first serious relationship and only sexual partner\n\nQuick and simple: I have never made a big deal out of sex, and, in general, would not mind an open relationship.  However, my SO would never ever allow me to be with another man, so because of that, in this case, I don't feel comfortable being in an open realtionship with him.  Because he knows my views on sex (that I don't care all that much about monogomy) he considers this to be me playing tit for tat with him, and considers it unreasonable.   He is young and has only been with me, I understand him wanting to explore sexually.  But again, I would not feel comfortable in a one sided open relationship.  He said its not about me, this is something he wants, why am I making it about myself, tit for tat, etc.  \n\nSimilar example: he got upset when I mentioned i wanted to go to a bar some years ago and said he's not comfortable with it. I respected that.  About a year later, he asked to go to a strip club with his friends. Here's the thing, do I care about a boyfriend I am with going to a strip club?  In general, No.  I get that it's all fun.  But again, I would expect that same freedom to be granted to me.  Because he would not even allow me to go to a bar even though I don't drink and would just go with friends to hang out, yeah, I told him no don't go, I don't feel comfortable. Again, another fight about how I'm fucking him around playing games with him.  I'm really not trying to, it's just with this particular situation I would have felt entirely disrespected.  He said it's my fault for feeling disrespected.",

We would hang out together, kiss and stuff, and then nothing again.\n\nWell, last week I get a message, that she is getting married with that \"friend\" (few days before that, she told me that she still likes me, and kissed a bunch). I couldn't believe it. I was trying to talk her out of that for the past week, but nothing came of it. She told me that she understands that she rushed it, that it can be a mistake and such, even told me that she doesn't love me. Yesterday she met up with a mutual friend, and she told that friend that she is happy, that she doesn't want to see me, and will call cops if I come near her.

Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note- they're about 70/30 as far as being jerks goes. Maybe 1/3 of the time they're actually decent to me, but I mostly end up feeling belittled and uncomfortable- it's a lot like High School. I've talked to him about this multiple times, and he says that A) I need to stand up for myself, and B) I need to let him know when I get upset, because he genuinely doesn't know what's making me upset, or what they say that sets me off.

It's the acting gay - acting *really* gay. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. It just seems disingenuous when someone's being as flamboyant as possible. I can understand it when someone's just coming out and feels the need to express their sexual identity, or in a pride parade - go wild, I say. \n\nBut when I see adult men acting like total queens, I just want to tell them to grow the hell up.

I've had her for a year and during this time, there is always one spot at a time she keeps licking, 4 in total so far, with one being here for months now on her front leg, fur is gone and it was infected before. She keeps licking until it bleeds, and when I find out I'll put ointment on it. I've been to the vet before because she seems to have developed an allergy to something randomly (started getting scaly skin and dandruff), but it hasn't been determined what it is yet (not food) and the licking issue, while brought up, wasn't really directly addressed.

Admittedly, we are both not great communicators. \n\nAfter our last real fight, he told me that we needed to go to counselling or we needed to break up. I agreed to try counselling. He has a specific group in mind he wants to go to, so I said to set up the sessions and we would go. This was over 3 weeks ago.\n\nSince then he's brushed off setting anything up, I can't set it up since I don't know the name of the only place he's willing to go to, and we're starting to bicker again. It's now at the point that if I mention something is wrong, or that I would have appreciated if X,Y, or Z had been done, I am accused of trying to start another fight. \n\nI'm at my wit's end here, am I being unfair for pressing him to do the thing he threatened to end our relationship over if it wasn't done?",

For the first two weeks I was on crutches, after which time my orthopedist said I could try going without them. I did that, and a few days later I slipped and fell, bashing up my leg and apparently badly re-injuring myself. After that I went back on the crutches, and kept using them until my follow-up appointment today. By all accounts the pain in my leg has gotten worse, and the only thing the doctor said was that we need to treat it more aggressively. This means I have to use the crutches for 4-6 more weeks, and I have to get blood work done to make sure my hormones aren't fucking with my body's ability to fix bones. \n\nDuring this \"recovery\" I was swimming and doing very light biking to keep my fitness up, but now I am forbidden from doing either of those activities. All I can do is sit still or walk around on crutches while I watch the last days of summer drifting by.

Hes been too sweet to me, massaging my back before I fell asleep last night, etc, so I feel like this might completely blindside him.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's lots about him I love, he's kind (most of the time), he can always make me laugh or smile with his goofy sense of humor, but I really don't know if I csn do this anymore.

I know I could go do all those things with other people while still with him but I fear the rarely seeing eachother due to our schedules would just end in a breakup anyways..\n\nSo what I need is advice - How do I do it?

In August of 2008, I had just quit grad school, hated my life, and was really exceptionally depressed.  I was renting a tiny bedroom in a house in the middle of nowhere, and I had no job.  [I weighed 245 pounds]  I got a job waiting tables, and my weight slowly began to drop.  Starting in November of 2009, I liked what had been happening and decided to actively try losing weight.  By September 2010, [I was down to about 190] had a great job, great friends, and was really, really stoked.\n\nHere's where things get tricky.  Around this time, I started dating a super-excellent guy.  Our social circles have meshed effortlessly, and we spend a lot of time together.  He's a really picky eater, though, and doesn't like most of the stuff that I do (which is, coincidentally, the food that's helped me lose weight), so we end up eating out a lot.  Not only has my wallet taken a solid hit, I've gained about 15 pounds since we started dating.  Not enough to really *see*, but I'm definitely more sluggish, and it bothers me a lot.  On top of all this, I've become much more busy, now that I have a \"real\" job and I have an active group of friends.\n\nWhat do I do, folks?  I really don't know where to go from here.  I honestly don't know what a good goal weight for me is, and while I can work more activity into my life pretty easily, I don't know how to deal with the \"I'm always out, what on earth do I eat?\" problem.\n\nI'm sorry if this was weirdly-phrased and rambly -- I'll clarify if y'all have questions, but I really would love some help on how to get myself together again.",

I'm his first girlfriend. \n\nIn my eyes, our relationship is like a wonderful dream. I've been in a long term relationship before (2 years) and it ended fairly amicable, but I know how shitty dating can be. We have so much in common, share wonderful memories and crack up together. We are in love. I'm cynical when it comes to relationships because I've experienced failure after failure, not to mention my parents are divorced. \n\nWe argue, a lot. Over almost anything. Usually, its my fault, but he's admitted we both can be childish at points. Our fights are passionate, usually quick, and we move on within the day. This taints the better part of our relationship, but not enough for either of us to want to end it. Although, we did break up about 5 months ago for maybe a week. (It was a drunken break up)\n\nIf I were to describe our relationship from his point of view, you all would probably think I was a psycho. I'm clingy and have a temper. I can be too sensitive and crave attention. Honestly, I hate it, and he knows I hate it. Change isn't easy to come by, and there are some emotional/depression/self esteem issues I should work out on my own.\n\nI guess my question is, how can I change my attitude to be a better girlfriend? Or should we break up for a while so I don't feel so attached to him? I see so much potential in our future together and love him dearly. I just want to make the right choices.",

I'm about to ask her to marry me, however, I'm suddenly feeling really hesitant and I think it's because she's 6 years older than me...\n\nMy girlfriend has always been a lot less mature than me, and I think that stems from the fact that she lived a very sheltered life. I was also her first real boyfriend, and she lost her virginity to me. She also looks about 10 years younger than she is, and people are always amazed that she's older than me. In essence, I've always felt like the older, and more mature person in our relationship. We are also in the same place career wise, and we both discussed wanting to have kids in about 3-4 years from now. \n\nDespite this, though, I can't help but worry about our age difference...It feels nonexistent now, but I worry that It'll be evident in the future...At times I think that 6 years is such a small age gap and that my worries are incredibly immature and nonsensical.

He's been in a relationship with his current girlfriend (Angela) for about a year and a half. For numerous reasons, I've only met her once about a year ago and she was very sweet and friendly. Since then we haven't seen each other because she travels for work and that's when Chris and I catch up; additionally, she has her own social life and on days when she wants to be alone with her friends, he and I will grab dinner. She never has a problem with that as far as I know.\n\nAnyway, I went out with Chris, Angela, and another couple on Saturday and when we were exchanging hello's she just glared at me. No response. I was shocked, but I thought she was in a bad mood and let it go. Throughout the night, however, she ignored me and didn't even look in my direction once. She was bubbly and friendly to the other couple but excluded me. When I did address her at one point (trying to be civil) she merely glared again and didn't respond. \n\nThe next day, I asked Chris what happened. He acknowledged that even the other couple noticed what was going on and texted him about it at the table. I assumed that he and Angela must have discussed it, but apparently he didn't raise the issue at all. I was shocked and hurt, and he defended his decision not to ask because he has bigger priorities now (they're having problems-- no wonder). This is out of character for him.\n\nI've never done anything to warrant this type of treatment and I'm concerned because we'll be at the same event in a couple of weeks hosted by his brother. I feel like I deserve an explanation, or at the very least, someone should raise the issue with her.\n\nHow do I discuss this again with Chris? :(",

She wants him to get married and have kids. he wants neither. he said he might just stay because he doesn't like change. he tells me he's lonely, even though she lives with him. \n\nBut he also listens to me... a lot... he thinks about things i say, and he remembers them. (i'm not sure if he does this with everyone). he has also watched my back in the office and does his best to support me and make sure i get my promotion. he offers tons of advice. sometimes our conversations are moody. I often confess a lot of personal things to him, and he will sometimes do the same. it feels very personal and intimate. these conversations can be dark and intense. sometimes those emotions are clearly written on our faces. He has also asked to spend time (getting lunch) with me out of the office. I have never done this with any of my other bosses. \n\nthe other day, i tried to help train a fellow employee and was being kind and nice to the employee. and my boss was upset with me. he lashed out (which he's never done) and asked me if I was bipolar and how i had changed to become such a different and happy person (in front of the new trainee). he then recoiled and withdrew. he asked me to leave his office.\n\nI like my boss. he's taken, but i feel a closeness to him. how can i tell if he is into me - or just likes having a sense of authority and mentorship over me? is there any way to tell ??? \n\nplease help. any advice is helpful. thank you !!",

I assumed from the lack of emotions I was feeling toward her and the lack of communication that I was getting over her.\n\nThen this week she visited my city.\n\nShe invited a bunch of our old friends (and myself) out for dinner, so I figured, sure, why not, let's cement her status as a friend. This will be casual enough.\n\nAnd it was. We had a great time, laughed like crazy, and found ourselves finishing each other's sentences like we did when we first fell for each other. It was a really fun night, closed with a loving goodbye hug.\n\nI say loving because the second I go, reality smacked me in the face. I was still in love with her, just as much as when I broke up with her. I spent the night brooding over it, and decided that the best course of action was to be blunt about it. I texted her the next day telling her in fairly simple terms what the night had done for me - it made me realize I was still head over heels for her.\n\nAnd she never responded.\n\nI'm entirely okay with that. Hell, I'm happy about that. It put things into perspective. Four months of acting like I was okay with being friends with a girl I never even had the chance to see that way wore on me. I realized how much self-respect I was abandoning just by keeping up this charade and allowing her to be how I validated myself.\n\nAnd, honestly? Fuck that. I'm awesome, and I don't need her to tell me that to know it. I feel like I've lifted a weight from my shoulders, and for the first time in four months I'm genuinely happy to be single.

Other co-workers have noticed it and joke with us about it...they'll say something like \"give that to your boss\" and he'll say \"pft\". It's getting annoying. What makes it tougher is that we were really cool back when we were at the same level. So that friendship carries over to now and we talk about common interests frequently. But when it comes to work it's different. I sympathize though. I understand it may hit his ego pretty hard to have to work for someone half his age that was previously his equal. But it's affecting my work and reputation. I already asked him nicely to stop going over my head. He wasn't too happy about it and that only lasted a week. I'm getting to where I want to stop being friendly about it and tell him that I'm his boss and he needs to do what I tell him to, but I'm afraid that will piss him off and he'll try to make my life miserable.

The building faces the ocean, but these people choose to back into the parking spot so they are facing the building, middle of winter so it's cold as balls outside, and just sit there.  Doing who the hell knows what.  It's so weird.\n\nAnyway one morning I wake up and my roommates rockin a piss already.  It's one of those mornings where I simply could not wait 30 seconds for him to finish, I had to piss *now*.  I did the only logical thing and swung open the sliding door to the deck (that faces the parking lot/ocean) and do my business in the warm doorway, giving that dirty deck a nice golden shower. \n\nThis happened at 6:15 am.  Before I pissed everywhere I was careful to check out the lot.  Every single car was off.  There was no wind; it was silent. I was sure no cars were running.  I scanned each car individually and they all appeared totally empty.  Perfect, open the flood gates.\n\nBut as fate would have it, on the one god damn morning I decide to piss out the deck door, halfway through my business some lone motherfucker just swings his car door open and hops out like it's nothing out of the ordinary to sit in his car at 6:15am doing literally nothing.  I had my pants pulled down just enough to reveal just my dick; I don't even care if he saw it.  I cared more about cutting off the flow and not dribbling all over the inside rug for fuck's sakes.\n\nWhat the fuck though, does anyone else experience this?

When I asked her the reasons why he would want to do that, she was not straightforward with me and I felt something was up.\n\nSo I found the number of the other guy and called him up.

Furthermore, he said that they do text each other in a while.\n\nWhen I confronted my girlfriend about all this, she confessed and said everything was true.

As for the reason for asking for a ride, she said she was just drunk with her friend and needed  a ride home (I don't have a car). \n\nShe said she didn't want to tell me about the truth because she didn't want me to get upset.

The evidence was falsified to begin with, Jenny McCarthy is an idiot, etc, etc. Vaccines have also, on the whole, been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever (probably). The evidence here is overwhelming.\n\nAnd yet, the \"vaccines are good and everyone should them\" mentality is too simplistic. The issue has many angles, and in a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things I am consistently surprised by the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.\n\nThe fact is, every medication--vaccines included--carries a real set of risks. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule. This is as indisputable as is the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nSo why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of the blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration?",

I know that she is devoted to me and I know that she loves me very much. I know she won't cheat on me and I am not jealous of her when she talks to other guys because I trust her. I am not even worried that I don't \"measure up\". \n\nSimply put, I am jealous of her because she's had sex with 7 different guys and I've only had one. I love everything about her, except for that. Every time I think about this, I just want to scream. It makes me acknowledge that she is an experienced woman that has gotten her fair share and gotten it out of her system (it's making my skin crawl as I'm even typing this), and I am just not. It also doesn't help that she is insanely cute and innocent looking. \n\nI know that she wants me, she tells me all the time that I'm better than everyone else. But this is a personal jealousy. If I had around the same number, I don't think this would have been a problem. It just reinforces the fact that I haven't gotten it out of my system, and I am afraid I might break up with her sometime in the future because of this. I don't want to, I really don't. I can't see myself with someone else. She is wonderful, I really do love her. But this is something that is putting strain on my feelings for her. It's sad but I wish we'd gotten together after I've had more experience under my belt.\n\nWhat can I do to get over this? I need to before I make a mistake.

She spends a lot of nights over at my place, and I noticed that whenever I went to take a shower before bed, after I came back she would be on my laptop and quickly close down some open tabs. I didn't think much of it the first few times, figuring maybe she was looking at something embarrassing, but then I noticed it turned into an every night thing whenever we spent a few days together.\n\nI checked my browser history, and she is looking at her ex's facebook. Specifically, her ex, and her ex's new girlfriend. I know that she had a rough breakup very shortly before we started dating. She was married to him for 6 years and said that he was very controlling and not a good match for her, and when she wanted to leave he put her through a huge guilt trip and made it difficult. I've noticed that about once a week she will exchange a few texts with him and be off in the bathroom crying about it. \n\nThat said, she has told me how happy she is with me and doesn't know why she is still sad about a bad relationship ending. I figured some of it was just curiousity over what her ex was doing and who he was with, but coupled with the crying about it makes me wonder if she is just not over him.\n\nI don't know what to do about the situation because when she does the weekly crying routine, she is emotionally wrecked for the whole night and it sucks. I've tried to be understanding and give her space, but it's not getting better. The Facebook thing also affects her. During the day/evening she will be flirty and talking about all the stuff we're going to do in bed, and then after I get out of the shower and she's been on his Facebook, it's like she's emotionally unavailable the rest of the night.\n\nI really love her though so I want to try and make it work, it's just I'm not sure of the right way to handle this situation.",

Just to understand what issues I am dealing with I should explain that he had no job, didn't graduate from high school, didn't pay or offer me anything but I was young and in love so it didn't matter.  \n\nAnyway, since then I've become a bit of a lone wolf.  I'm a fiercely independent woman, almost to a fault.  I kind of feel like it may be that I'm trying to prove something but I'm not sure what that is.\n\nI met a guy about 5 months ago through some mutual friends.  We have a lot of common interests like guns, camping and generally having a good time.  We started dating seriously about a month ago and he refers to me as his girlfriend.  \n\nWithin the past two days we've realized we are different.  He's conservative with traditional values and I'm more liberal and unconventional.  It's almost a good thing because he's grounding me a little more and I'm opening up his mind to different ways of thinking.  However, I've realized that he's a bit self absorbed.  Not in a narcissistic way but he only seems to be able to relate things through himself.  I put a lot of effort into being interested in his projects but he doesn't make an effort to being interested in my projects.  I can tell that issues from my last relationship are urging me to abandon ship immediately for fear of being hurt again and I wonder if I'm almost TRYING to find reasons to leave.  \n\nBasically, we have two issues.  I had basically conviced myself that I wanted to be alone but I found a guy I genuinely care about.  He makes me happy and the thought of being with him doesn't make me nauseous.

Bodies are natural systems, respect yours, it can only change so much so fast. The changes some people here are making are so all encompassing that encountering these problems means you deserve a pat on the back because they represent just how far you've come. Plateau after losing 100lbs? It makes me think \"oh, you're frustrated? And are you virtually unrecognizable from who you were last year? Are you able to fucking enter a gym without feeling awkward? Let alone exercise without feeling like death?\".

Things started to get better as I mentioned above (late 09) and I worked in finance from that date until a month or so ago.\n\nI was wondering if I should mention the other jobs at all, or focus on one or two others. If I do that though, how can I explain the gaps?\n\nI know it seems as if I am focusing on the length of time I have stayed at various jobs. However, I know how important that is, especially in full time roles.\n\nI would really appreciate some help with this matter. If you need further information, please ask.",

Without a doubt it is him. I went through his comment history.\nPredating his meeting me, he has a history of seeking out American women in our field on the internet and being abusive to them. Most of the self-identified American women on the 'net he is responding to are seeking advice or help; he is responding to them with hatred and vitriol and derision, I don't think I can type the words he is using and not get caught by the filter, but, he is using all of the typical anti-American slurs and all of the typical anti-female slurs.

She's incredibly loving and supportive; We never fight and the reason for the breakups basically come from me growing bored of the relationship and feeling that our interests don't align.\n\nI recently moved overseas for work and broke up with her for the reasons above and because of the distance. But after two months of silence, we've been talking regularly and last night we admitted we still have feelings for each other and want to be together but don't know what to do.

        "181": "POST: I had a book when I was a kid in the early or mid 80s ... about a cat that has a bad habit of eating shoelaces.  It tells a moral story about gluttony/overindulgence and the cat gets bigger and bigger.  I think it also ate typewriters, or maybe just the keys.  The cat's parents are involved at some point.  The cat is reproved -- maybe by a doctor? -- who convinces the cat to eat such treats in moderation.  There might have also been turnips?? but I might be confusing the turnip part with a different book.  The book ends with the cat losing weight, and he only *occasionally* indulges in a typewriter key.   I remember the drawings -- a cat with shoelaces hanging all out of its mouth, and I think there were a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys.  To my recollection the drawings were black and white, pen-style.  Obviously this book left an impression on me.  I was hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but I can't find it anywhere.  You would think the terms \"cat\", \"typewriter\", \"shoelaces\" aren't usually combined and would easily point to something.

A can for free, on the house.\" Surprised, I walked over to the table where his setup was and also where a female coworker of his was standing and he then handed me a can and said, \"Okay, so it's only $10.\" Again, I was surprised, and instead of disputing his offer, I went ahead and pulled out my credit card and paid for it. Oh, and there was a $2 tax on the damn thing so it actually came out to $12.\n\nHe ran my card, handed me a receipt, and the transaction was over. I'm sure he felt good about having basically hustled me into walking over there under the impression that I'd get a free can and then actually making a sale. I handed him the can back and said, \"I want you to give this to the next person you promise a free can to. Now you can actually keep your word,\" and got back in my car and drove off.\n\nIt felt good doing this and I'd love to hear some stories of similar things that you may have done to help others at your cost, perhaps to prove a point or just to flat out pay it forward.",

        "201": "POST: All right, here's the deal. When the semester started, I met this girl in my Chem lab and we started talking. Infrequently for a while, but around a month ago started to pick up to the point that it was every day for the past few weeks. Anyway, I was very much into this girl. She's very pretty, and shares so many interests with me, it was a little surreal. \n\nTwo weeks ago we went on a date, which went really well, we ended up kissing at the end and I was a happy man. Ideally we would have had a second date this weekend or last, but it was easter and she went home, and this weekend is out for other reasons. So here's the problem. Starting earlier this week, our contact started to taper off, effectively not talking whatsoever this week. Obviously I was a little concerned, given how much we'd been talking before, so I said I'd like to talk to her, and she said she wanted to talk to me as well. \n\nSo we talk on the phone a bit, and here's the issue. She tells me that she wasn't sure if we were a couple or not (something we hadn't discussed, and I wasn't clear on either), and that she didn't feel ready to be in a couple. She said that she was still emotional over her last breakup, and she didn't feel emotionally ready to be in a relationship with me yet. This is followed by saying that she does really like me and wants to keep hanging out and talking and all that jazz. I of course understand that you can't control feeling not ready, and told her that, and saying that while disappointed, I wouldn't guilt trip her or pressure her into anything. \n\nAnyway, the vibe that I got was that a relationship wasn't off the table, just not right now. I feel that any relationship we would have would be a healthy, lengthy, and fulfilling one. So I suppose my wondering here is what I should do to make it clear that I am open to a relationship and fostering that relationship potential, while maintaining the friendship and giving her the time she needs.",

Background: I lost my contract job as a Sr. Systems Admin in December due to the dissolution of my department and I've been looking for work since.  The problem has been that my last job before this one was also contract and also one in which I was let go before the end of the contract term.  That unemployment stretch lasted about three months.  During that time, I applied to about 15-20 jobs per week and had an interview roughly every week and a half.  \n\nThis time around, with more experience and the same level of effort, I have had a total of 3 interviews, but these were not direct hires so I'm faced with the same risks as I have been at the last two positions. I've been targeting System admin/SQL developer/Business Analyst and Jr DBA-type positions both locally and out-of-state. Honestly, I'm not sure if it's my resume or the positions I'm applying to (or the fact that I don't have a CS degree), but I was really hoping for some feedback/advice on what I can do to get some interest.\n\nPlease see the redacted resume below.",

When we were in highschool, we could hide this by talking about classes and the like, but now that we don't have any classes, teachers, or experiences in common, our chatting has dried to just about nil.\n\nI am quite the extrovert and can't stand staying inside for a whole day, whereas she is quite introverted and wouldn't mind spending a day in bed doing nothing. I have an array of hobbies (not the least of which is dicking around on this website :P), whereas she tends to try something a bit on my suggestion, and quickly decide it's not for her, and go back to her pastime of rewatching TV shows she's already seen. \n\nI enjoy being around her, and going on dates is enjoyable. We don't have any 'dramatic' issues, and haven't had any fights in the time we've been together. But I think that deep down we are sort of seeing that that might just be a byproduct of the fact that we don't have much at all in common to have any sort of passionate argument about.",

An exclamation point takes no extra time to type in an e-mail and if a student comes to you during their own free time to show you something they thought was interesting and relevant, chances are they have taken a liking to you. When you show an obvious disinterest in your student, not only are you probably hurting their feelings, you're also chipping away at their interest in education. It wouldn't kill you to take a couple minutes to listen to why they thought their piece was so absorbing.

And not boring things that only I would like, but stuff like going to a baseball game. He agrees or I guess brushes me off and we never do anything.  All I want is to get out and off the couch on occasion, but he seems content with always doing that.  I couldn't tell you how many times I've talked to him about doing things together.\n\nI guess what really has me pissed at the moment is that he spent all day yesterday helping his new female roommate move in.  I'm not threatened by her and I know nothing would ever happen. What I am mad about though is he hasn't done anything like that for me in a long time.  I moved a couple months ago and he didn't lift a finger or offer to help.

He'll go out with his friends, but never with me.  \n\nIt just sucks to not feel like a priority after 2 years.

We are private people and generally stay in my room reading books together. However, my roommate screamed that he is not allowed over at all, because it would make her uncomfortable. Now, I am paying my fair share of rent, we've split it evenly, even though she gets the bigger room.

I have tried reasoning with her, telling her that she could have told me no to moving in Sunday, instead of throwing a temper tantrum, but she is set. When I tried reasoning with her, she told me that clearly I cannot think like an adult, therefore she is taking away my privileges to change plans. Lunch plans, dinner plans, general hanging out plans....etc. Meanwhile, she has bailed on me nearly every single time we make plans together, often only an hour or two before.\n\n    What have I gotten myself in to???

        "229": "POST: My GF recently became my fiancee.  I am sure she's been planning this day for a while in her head, but the only two details I've heard so far is that it is a \"$60k wedding\" and \"the groom/his family\" pays for it.  For reference, she is not from the U.S. originally (although she became a citizen in her teens), so her culture is weighing in here.  Her culture (middle eastern) is big on over-the-top events and the professional success to back it up.\n\nWe can technically afford this wedding, as between us we make about $300k/year, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous.  It might even cause negative feelings with my family because no one has had a wedding that cost even half that much.\n\nThe problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap.  I believe that she should get the day she wants, but I also think she could have just as great of a wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), so my challenge is to convince her that she could be happy, especially if it means we can keep it from impacting other milestones.  For example, she has already started talking about buying a house in the next 1-2 years.  Well, the average house exceeds $1 million in our area, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so if we are to contribute equally to the downpayment. (I'm 100% footing the bill for the wedding, remember).  We also both agree on trying to become financially independent of work as soon as possible, and are in general frugal people.  For example, we live in an old, cheap apartment, and she recently bought a used car.\n\nWhat can I do here?  Advice from people with non-American partners is particularly appreciated",

Today I realized that even though I gladly know nothing of her sex life(existent or not) she isn't a 9 year old girl who doesn't know what sex is. I then started browsing Reddit and saw a post about how a dad had discovered his daughter pretty much riding her boyfriend. I thought about how not only our dad but a ton of dads are probably devastated that their \"little girl\" is having sex. At this point I was for some reason really angry and didn't know why.

I need to note here that I have never said one way or the other that it is wrong, she just felt like it would upset me. We have had an open conversation about the situation, and out of my trying to respect her and wanting her to be herself I told her that where I was a little uncomfortable with it, if that's what she wanted then I will do my best to be okay with it. \n\nReality is, I am not really okay with the situation. She has offered to include me and the other girl in certain sexual acts which at first sounded like a great thing, but the more I think about it, the more I hate the idea.

I know this is a pretty common thing.\n\nThe other biggest and hardest thing about all of this, is my wife has a girl she is interested in already. She was honest about meeting her and everything, and is already arranging to meet up with the other girl.

We went back to a friends house where I ended up falling asleep. The problem: I went to bed alone (he has a spare bedroom which he let me use because I lived half an hour away from him) but in the middle of the night I woke up being in between two of my male friends. We were fully clothed so I just assumed they would rather share a bed than just sleep on the floor, which didn't bother me, but the friend behind me was touching me in very private places (he didn't go under clothing though). I could hear him whispering things to himself and it was very obvious he was horny. I felt very uncomfortable about this and panicked so I pretended that I was still sleeping. This probably lasted for about an hour and even if I moved to try and get him off of me he would just pull me back.\nWhat I'm asking now is, what do I do?

However, in the last year I wanted to get my shit together because she is a pretty kick ass girl.\n\nI don't know why I sent naked pics and flirted like I did while in a relationship.  It just something I got a thrill from doing (and in the end, help me get off).  I would feel guilty about it afterwards though.  \n\nMy partner's father cheated on her mother and hurt her pretty good by it.  So I understand her trusting issues and I haven't done anything to help it with what I've done.  It is too the point where she monitors me closely everyday.  She does go through my facebook, phone, and email to see if I'm doing it again.  Once again, I understand why.\n\nMy biggest problem is because I have done these things in the past, I feel like I've doomed this relationship.  How can I ever feel like the perfect guy for her when I've screwed up so many times.  I can't pretend that I the knight in shinning armor.  Because of all this, I feel like this relationship is at a standstill and we are just together cause its comfortable.  I don't want that, I want to go back and treat her right and be the best I can, but I don't think the past will allow that.  What can I do?",

I appreciate her, because she likes the whole me with every flaw I have. It's worth to note that I'm her first boyfriend.\n\nThe problem is that I really don't think that I love her as much as I did before and she certainly loves me way more as I far as I can see it.\n\nI think I might be wasting her time, because I'm constantly thinking of being with other women, but I would never act on it, these are just thought, but they're there nonetheless. I really think this is unfair to her on my part. \n\nI had only 2 relationships in my life counting this one too, so I'm not experienced one bit. A few people with whom I discussed my problems said that these are not good signs. **What's your opinion?** Would you break up so you don't waste her time or try to work it out somehow?\n\n*Thank you for reading!",

It seemed like a perfect match until one day he gave me the \"it's not you, it's me\" (which albeit was valid, as he does suffer from severe depression). It took me a while, but I recovered. That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started going on casual dates and meeting new people. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in my social life. A few weeks ago, I met this guy at a party, and we started flirting, nothing crazy, kissed, then I left. I thought it was a one-off thing, but we ended up going on a few dates before break and talk a lot now. \n\nHe's made it very clear that he wants a relationship. He doesn't play mind games (my ex did and I hated it) and is genuinely very sweet and we're surprisingly compatible. Honestly, I could see it working out really well. The issue is that I have found that I really enjoy the single life. After giving so much to a relationship and watching it flounder, I realized that I can be all that I need, and while this new guy is wonderful, I don't really want the commitment attached to a 'relationship'. I'm still really young and I want to enjoy college. At the same time, I don't want to miss out on a potentially really wonderful guy, nor do I want to hurt him at all. Help?",

The dog is outside every day on my way to/from class and to/from the gym, and most of the rest of the time it seems. I live in North Philadelphia, not the nicest place, so I don't hang around the fence but every day as I pass, the dog is laying either on the pavement (Next to about 10 piles of it's droppings) or in this wooden shack looking dog house. Today the dog was sitting right along the fence. It's face was just droopy and miserable, it's eyes were blood red, and it seemed to have an abrasion/patch of fur missing on it's side/front leg. The last time I was this close to the dog, it barked at me. Today, it just stared blankly. I've been wondering what I can/should do all semester. Is there someone I can/should call? Should I mind my own business? In any other situation I'd have ZERO problem confronting someone about a case such as this (I'm a pretty decent sized guy) but as I said, I don't live in a great area and many of the locals here don't take kindly to students as it is.

With my salary I can pay for m half of the bills. He is an hourly manger but is working overtime, so he can make his ends meet as well. \n\nWell, he just put in his 2 weeks notice at his job today because his boss accused him of stealing from him and threaten him of \"breaking his fucking hand\" if he ever stole from him again.

I have about 2500 in debt right now and I am now worried about whats going to happen to our apartment. If we cant pay for it, its really going to affect us on our future like our credit score. Also our electricity bills and internet is under our names so that will affect us too. \n\nNow we just got over a heated discussion because he said I wasn't supporting him on his decision. He said, right away I told him he was wrong for leaving the job. That I didnt believe in him cause he kept saying \"things are going to be ok.  I can find another job, its not a big deal\".  \nWe also got in an argument about him thinking his team is going to follow him into whatever new job he has. I told him, in a restaurant youre by yourself, theres no such thing as a team. \n\nMy question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about whats going to happen?

        "10": "Hi there! I recently did some research on different models of wrist-mounted GPS units and my main concerns were cost and functionality. After looking around, I decided to go with the Forerunner 305 because it had all the features I wanted and was a good price, even though it's quite large. The best price I found online was through Amazon for around $130, with free shipping if I was willing to wait 1-2 weeks. However, I found out that it was available at my local Best Buy for $150. I did a quick search and found a printable coupon that was valid for the month of February, which gave me 20% off all \"Health & Fitness\" products. \n\nWhen I went into Best Buy, the price on the shelf was $160. I found an employee nearby who just happened to be a cute girl, and told her that I wanted to get the 305. She told me that she had that model and loved it, even more than some of the more expensive ones she had tried, even though it's huge. She said that she had run some marathons and we chatted a bit about how I was just starting to run. She told me about some of the runs in the area, how the best ones tend to end with beer, and overall was very pleasant and informative while we waited in line at the cashier. I'm definitely hoping to meet more cool people like her while pursuing this sport.\n\nWhen I got to the cashier, the 305 rang up at $160 as expected. I mentioned that the web site price was $150 and they agreed to match it. Then I gave them the 20% off coupon but it wouldn't scan. The cashier tried typing in the number but it still wouldn't take it. So he tried again and it accepted the coupon, but didn't apply the discount to the 305. He read the coupon, looked at the GPS, manually entered the 20% off and had a supervisor approve it. It was super easy and I was able to leave with the GPS for only $120.\n\nThe coupon should work on any \"Garmin Fitness GPS\" (which is an actual category on the Best Buy website), as well as any heart rate monitor or other brand of fitness GPS. Here's a link to the coupon. I hope it will be useful for someone out there within the next couple weeks. It expires on February 28th, 2011.",

        "24": "Alas, for the past few weeks, my beloved has been longing to visit a haunted house, her requests echoing through the halls of our hearts. With a gentle jest, I sought to deflect her inquiries, whispering softly, \"Yes, only if someone holds my hand,\" and confessing that I am not one to seek out the realm of fear. \n\nThe truth is that I struggle to bear the weight of anxiety, and scarce can I even watch films of terror, so overwhelmed am I by its presence. \n\nAnd so, a week ago, I agreed to accompany my love to the haunted house, at her behest. Today, the day of our intended journey, I revealed my trepidation, confessing that I feared I would not find joy in the experience, burdened as I am by my anxiety. Yet still, I offered to go if she so desired. \n\nMy beloved seemed to perceive my confiding in her as a betrayal, lamenting that I should have spoken my truth from the outset, and questioning why I waited until the last moment to express my discomfort. \n\nWith a heartfelt apology, I assured her that if she truly wished to go, I would still accompany her, though it may not be a pleasurable experience for me. She fell silent after this, her focus turning to the sorrow of my perceived failure. \n\nI then suggested that we should still venture forth and partake in another activity, even if she wished to remain within the safety of our abode. She initially declined my proposal, but eventually conceded, saying, \"You plan what we'll do then. I just wanted to do something that we could not do any other time of the year. Where could we even go out to dine that we have not already been?\" (These words are not verbatim, but rather a poetic rendering of her sentiment)\n\nI acknowledge that I could have communicated more directly when she first spoke of the haunted houses a few weeks ago. I take responsibility for that. \n\nMy question now is: What do I do now that my beloved is so disheartened, her spirit seemingly weighed down by despair? How can I transform this evening into a moment of joy, or is such a thing no longer possible? \n\nAny additional guidance, unrelated to my primary queries, is deeply appreciated.  Thank you!",
        "25": "Hello Reddit,\n\nSo earlier in the year, an old school friend of ours came into the group with a long distance boyfriend, and nobody was really bothered by it at first. However, after a while, the \"hatin'\" started to come up, and it became clear that some people in our circle were not happy about the situation. After a while, she broke up with the guy, and I watched as some of the people in my circle tried to pursue her. Initially, I wasn't interested in pursuing her myself, but she is genuinely a good person, so I decided to give it a try. Everything seemed to be going well until she flaked on me, and I decided to move on. Later on, I found out that the same thing had happened to another person who had tried the kiss-ass method of trying to win her over.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and everyone still hangs out together, but there is a veil of passive aggressive behavior between us. I can see that some of the people in my circle are still trying to pursue her, which makes me feel uncomfortable and frustrated. To make things worse, one of my friends keeps obsessing over her in my presence, and it hits at my underlying feelings of loneliness since I have never had a true relationship. I feel like I need another group of friends to chill with, but I don't know how to go about dealing with the consequences of such a move. I am worried that if I decide to leave the group and find another group of friends to hang out with, it could cause tension and awkwardness between us, and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or make things even more uncomfortable than they already are.",
        "26": "Dear reader, I am writing to you today because I am feeling very overwhelmed and frustrated with my current situation. I am thinking of severing all ties with my family, mostly because they are a bunch of self righteous Christian people who feel as if by them paying for me so far, (feeding me and letting me live with them rent-free) I am not only their slave, but am expected to mindlessly agree with everything they say and do. This is a very difficult situation for me to be in, as I feel like I am not being treated with the respect and dignity that I deserve. They think that I am not capable of leading my own life, and I know for a fact that if they knew half the stuff I deal with/get up to in college they would throw me out. This is a very concerning thought for me, as I am trying to make the most of my college experience and I do not want to be judged or punished for it. In addition, they get angry with me when I do what they ask because five minutes later they change their minds, and when I wait to see if they actually want it done they get even madder. This is a very frustrating situation for me, as I feel like I am constantly being put in a difficult position where I am expected to read their minds and anticipate their needs. They show me no respect, and yet expect me to show them respect when their behavior merits none. \n\nSome information about me: I am 20 years old and I am currently attending a state college, where I am studying to be a teacher. I am not really that into all the religious stuff, but I am not an atheist either. I work at my local YMCA as a swim instructor/lifeguard, which is a job that I enjoy and am passionate about.\n\nI am trying to think of ways that I could effectively cut the ties with my family. At this point the best solution I have come up with is to join some branch of the military, such as the navy or something, because my job doesn't pay enough for me to move out on my own and continue my education. This is a difficult decision for me to make, as I am not sure if joining the military is the right choice for me. However, I feel like it may be the only way for me to gain some independence and distance from my family. When I am at school, things are sort of OK as I go far enough away that they don",

        "28": "Dear Reddit, I made a mistake this morning. I woke up with a nasty cold and decided to take a shower before getting ready for school. I thought to myself, \"Why don't I just blow my nose in the shower, as it will all just go down the drain anyway?\" Therefore, I proceeded to blow my nose, and large chunks of mucus came flying out of my nose and onto the bottom of the tub. They were so large that I had to intentionally direct the water flow onto them in order to make them move. After getting out of the shower, I felt much better and put on my clothes. As I was downstairs gathering my belongings, I could hear my roommate getting up and walking into the bathroom. I was then greeted by the sound of her screaming, \"Oh my goodness!\" I quickly went upstairs and saw her standing in the bathroom looking down into the tub. She told me, verbatim, \"Shadowheart321, I understand that men have needs, but please can you keep it out of the shower and keep it in your room?\" \n\nI realized when I looked into the tub that we had recently installed a new drain catch and all of my nasal mucus was stuck in it. I quickly explained to her that it was not what she thought and that I was simply very sick and had to blow my nose, and that it was not what she thought. However, she was not listening and was still staring into the tub with an appalled expression on her face. As I attempted to explain what had happened, my other roommate walked into the room to see what the commotion was about. Before I could even try to explain what had occurred, he looked into the tub and started laughing loudly. In a last ditch effort to prove to them that it was not what they thought, I leaned over, stuck my hand into the drain catch and scooped up some of my nasal droppings and asked them to take a deep sniff of it. Then both of them turned out of the bathroom looking queasy as I stood there with a handful of mucus in my palm. Unfortunately, I will now be known as the person who picked up their own nasal mucus from the bottom of the shower and asked them to smell it.",

I asked one of my friends if he wanted to go check out the \"amazing\" wooden jungle gym with 4 swings and a big slide. We headed over there and I took a seat on one of the swings while my friend sat on the opposite one, without even swinging! I said to him, \"I used to have one just like this when I was a kid,\" and BAM! The support beam holding up the swings snapped in half and the swing set collapsed. \n\nNeedless to say, I felt awful and my friend was a bit miffed, but he got over it quickly because he's a nice guy like that. After telling his parents this morning, he texted me saying that they weren't at all mad and actually wanted to get rid of it for a while anyways, so I guess I did him a favor. But when his 3 yo brother saw it, he burst out laughing and was extremely amused by the whole situation. I still feel bad about it though, even though his family is OK with it.

        "32": "As someone who is new to Reddit, I understand that default subreddits are subreddits with a certain number of subscribers which makes them visible to people who aren't signed into Reddit or haven't added or removed any subreddits. However, I am finding that some of these default subreddits, such as atheism and politics, can be very off-putting due to the way in which discussions are conducted and the comments from the community. It seems that these subreddits offer a set of narrow principles which can be intimidating for those who do not agree with them, such as religious people or Republicans/conservatives. On the other hand, subreddits that are more neutral and encourage intelligent discussion tend to be much more welcoming to all. Subreddits like videos or funny's are neutral anyway and could be a good 'hook' for new users. I hesitate to recommend Reddit to my friends because they may see some of the incredibly narrow and arrogant opinions expressed in certain default subreddits and associate that with me, which is not something I want.

        "33": "Hello, it seems that you have been in a relationship with your partner for almost 4 years now, and you are feeling like you are just good friends who have sex. It is understandable that you may be feeling this way, as it appears that any type of affection you give him is usually discounted as \"needy\" or \"clingy\" and not as \"I love you\". This can be quite hurtful and make you feel unloved and invalidated. \n\nOne example of this is when you worked together and he was leaving early for a doctor's appointment. You decided to walk out to the parking lot with him, but he kept saying, \"It's ok\" and \"I'm fine you don't have to worry\", when all you were doing was just walking him out because you felt like it. This could be seen as him dismissing your feelings and not recognizing the fact that you were simply showing your affection for him.\n\nAnother example was when you hadn't really spent much time together in the past few weeks and so when you finally were able to hang out together, you told him that you missed him. He looked at you weird and said, \"But I see you all the time....\", totally blowing off the fact that this was the first time we actually got to hang out in a while. This could be seen as him not taking into account the fact that this was the first time in a while that you had been able to spend quality time together, which could be seen as him not valuing your feelings or understanding how important it was for you to spend time together.\n\nThese are just a few examples of things that have happened recently, but it seems that this is an ongoing issue with your relationship and you feel so unloved because you don't feel like your feelings are being reciprocated by him. You may feel like your feelings are annoying to him and bother him, which can be very difficult to deal with. It is understandable that you do not want to break up, but at the same time, it can be hard to always wonder if he doesn't reciprocate your affection because he doesn't love you. He has mentioned that in previous relationships he was cuddly and affectionate, but his ex girlfriends were cold and distant (according to him). This could be a sign that he may have difficulty expressing his emotions or showing affection, which could be contributing to the issues in your relationship.",

        "36": "Hi, Reddit,\n\nI have come here to ask a few questions and I would like to thank you all in advance for taking the time to read this. I am a police officer and my boyfriend is a bartender. We have been together for about 3 years now and we have had a lot of ups and some downs. When we first met (before I was in law enforcement), we would frequently hang out at bars together. Now, I work night shift and my patrol area is a large group of bars where I basically deal with drunk people constantly throughout the night.\n\nMy boyfriend is a bartender in that bar area. Lately, he has been going out and drinking (mostly beer I believe) until about 1am, give or take, in this bar district. He does this while I am at work over night. He does this about 3-4 times a week. \n\nSometimes it hurts my feelings because I work so hard in that area to do my job. I am dealing with people who are cussing at me, throwing up on me, working car accidents, dealing with people who are driving while intoxicated, etc. It hurts me to think about my boyfriend hanging out and drinking at these bars while I am working my butt off overnight. If it was occasionally, I wouldn't mind, but it is several nights a week. \n\nI know that my job is dangerous and I picked my career so I should deal with it. I don't feel like I deserve any special treatment but it also hurts when he decides to stay out and drink instead of coming by the house to say goodbye or anything at all before I go to work. I'm not saying that he should be there every single day, but maybe he could at least shoot me a text or something at least. \n\nI feel bad for letting it bother me, and I don't want to feel this way. I also don't know who he is with or when he will eventually go home so that adds to it. He knows my feelings on the situation but I feel that he does what he wants sometimes and will just brush it off or just apologize for it later.\n\nI don't want to nag him, he is a grown man, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I could have a potential future with him considering my career. \n\nIs this normal for guys to do and am I just overreacting?",

It was truly a match made in heaven, and they were so happy that they could hardly contain their excitement!\n\nHowever, one week ago (a month ago), things took a turn for the worse. Our heroine went on a trip and met a lot of guys, which caused our hero to become incredibly jealous. This led to a series of crazy fights, with tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. There was one fight in particular that just screwed everything up, and after that, they went back to our hero's house and broke up. But wait, there's more! In a moment of weakness, they made a mistake and spent the night together (their last night), which only added fuel to the fire.\n\nAfter that, things went from bad to worse. They fought a lot, and they basiclly hurted eachother a lot, with our heroine telling our hero things that were really offensive (like \"your hair looks like a rat's nest\" or \"your breath smells like a garbage dump\"). I guess our hero did the same to her as well, with comments like \"your cooking tastes like cardboard\" or \"your fashion sense is worse than a blindfolded monkey's.\"\n\nNow, they don't speak, and if our hero tries to speak with her, she will probably block him (using WhatsApp, Facebook, and maybe even smoke signals). Despite all of this, our hero still loves her so much and wants to get her back. He feels like he has to, because it's been a month and nothing has changed. He thinks she still loves him too, but she said she doesn't want to be with him. Oh, the drama!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our hero reveals that they have broken up in the past, about 4-5 times, but always got back together.

We now think the scallywags who had 'im before us were violent towards 'im (if ye mime kickin' he runs across the room terrified), so, me question is: he is best behaved on walks when wearin' a choke chain, and it isn't hurtin' 'im at all, but will the harm chokers and the people usin' them caused 'im in the past affect 'im in any way now? I 100% DO NOT want to use a choke chain on 'im and I don't think anyone should ever, ever train a dog that way, but this chain is the only lead we've used that has completely solved the problem with 'im pullin', and he hasn't seemed stressed out by it. If he ever started pullin' on the lead so that the choker was tight, I'd stop usin' it straight away. The last thing I want is me dog bein' hurt. If I'd known these relatives were goin' to put one on 'im, I wouldn't have let 'em look after 'im. Still, it works and doesn't hurt 'im, me only worry is it'll do psychological damage somehow.

        "52": "I am writing to seek advice on how to overcome a trigger that I have developed as a result of being in a bad relationship with my ex for 9 years. I have been single for the past 4 years, and have recently started dating again. However, I have realized that I have a trigger that I want to overcome. My ex was a serial cheater and it was often with women from work. Eventually, I came to know that anytime he was talking about \"my friend from work\", he really meant whatever girl at work he was having an affair with. This has caused me to develop a trigger in my brain that makes me think that anytime someone talks about their female co-workers, they must be sleeping with them. So, fast forward to dating and I have met a great guy. However, when he talks about his female co-workers, it sets off this stupid trigger in my brain that makes me think that he must be sleeping with them. I hate it and it really is bothering me. I want to know how I can make this trigger go away and stop myself from thinking that every time someone talks about their female co-workers, they must be sleeping with them. How can I make this go away?",

She farts every other day, and while she's not doing it to be funny or obnoxious, it really bothers me. I mean, they don't even smell bad, but I just can't stand hearing them! It honestly makes me feel less attracted to her. I'm assuming my other girlfriends were holding in their farts too, but I've only been dating my current girlfriend for seven months, so maybe that's why I'm not comfortable with it yet. Maybe if we stay together for longer and have more intimacy with each other, eventually I'll be able to laugh it off. But at the moment, I'm not sure how to bring it up in a sensitive way - has anyone else dealt with this hilarious situation?",

Sometimes I'm really into her and other times I'm less into her. She is the first girl I've actually dated (in that we see and talk to each other almost daily and are exclusive) and she really likes me. I'm wondering if this is something that will happen later on as we see each other more. I never expected this to be a super serious relationship with marriage potential, but I feel like I should be feeling more affection towards her than I am. Another issue is that she is a really sweet and nice person, and her family and friends already know about me. If I decide to end the relationship in the coming weeks or months, I'm worried that it would really hurt her, which is not something I want. If I decide it should end, is there a way to break it off in a non-depressing way and maintain her as a good friend?",

I accepted her apology and tried to move on, but it has been difficult for me. On Monday night, I was waiting for her to come home but she didn't answer my calls or texts. I was worried about her, so I used the Find My Iphone service to see where she was. I saw that she was at a local bar, so I went to confront her. When I got there, I didn't see her car in the parking lot, but then I found it parked in the back. I found her with a guy she works with, and now we are both feeling very upset and confused. I don't think I can trust her anymore, and I'm feeling like I need to start my life over. It's really hard because I wanted to marry her. I don't know if it counts as cheating since I didn't catch them having sex, but in my eyes she lied to me and was with another guy while I was at work, which feels like cheating to me. I'm looking for any advice or support that people can offer. Thank you for listening.",
        "58": "It seems that there is a lot of tension and misunderstanding between you and your partner. You have been together for 5 years, and both of you are 24 years old. You are his first serious relationship and only sexual partner, which may explain why he is feeling insecure about the idea of an open relationship. However, you have made it clear that you do not mind an open relationship in general, but because he would never allow you to be with another man, you do not feel comfortable being in an open relationship with him. This is understandable, as it feels like a one-sided arrangement where he gets to explore sexually while you are not allowed the same freedom. \n\nYour partner seems to be viewing this situation as you playing \"tit for tat\" with him, which he considers to be unreasonable. He may be feeling entitled to explore sexually since he is young and has only been with you, but it is important to remember that relationships should be based on mutual respect and understanding. It is also worth noting that you have respected his wishes in the past when he asked you not to go to a bar, even though you do not drink and would just go with friends to hang out. However, when he asked to go to a strip club with his friends, you felt uncomfortable with the idea as you would expect the same freedom to be granted to you. This is a valid concern, as it feels like he is not respecting your boundaries and is instead trying to take advantage of the situation. It is understandable why you would feel disrespected by this, and it is not fair for him to blame you for feeling this way. It seems that there needs to be more communication and compromise between the two of you in order to resolve this issue.",

After breaking up, you had some positive moments together, including talking about your feelings and having intimate moments. However, it seems that things became confusing and difficult for you when she started ignoring you and then suddenly got into a relationship with someone else. It must have been very hurtful to hear that she was getting married to this other person, especially since she had told you that she still liked you and kissed you. You tried to talk her out of it, but unfortunately nothing changed. It seems that she is now happy with her decision and does not want to see you anymore, which is understandable given the circumstances. I can imagine how painful this must be for you, and I hope that you are able to find support and healing during this difficult time.",

He moved in with his old college room mates about a year ago, and they're a terrible influence on him. Before he moved in there, he used to go to the gym regularly, eat well, and go to church. Since he's moved in with them, he's gained about 30 lbs. To be fair, I've gained weight as well since we started dating, but it's mostly because I started at a University with a meal plan, and later on I could only afford cheap, less-healthy food. I've been trying to work with him constantly for both of us to go to the gym more, eat better, and go to church together.  He ends up going out to eat way more than he should (his friends all have good paying jobs and don't really care about their health, while he's still looking for a job in his field of study), and is just generally negatively affected by the environment. I like the person he is when we're alone a lot better than him around his guy friends. It seems like he just makes a lot of poor choices around this group. I don't know how to go about telling him this...I know guys can be sensitive when it comes to their friends, though he already knows I don't like his friends. They give me a hard time a lot and tend to make me feel like crap- they've actually reduced me to tears a few times. On that note-",

It's understandable that you felt uncomfortable when your friend left you to go find someone to dance with, as you don't feel comfortable with people you barely know rubbing up against you. It must have been even more difficult when you barely saw your other friend and when you did, it was just to dance. I can imagine that it was especially challenging for you given your severe social anxiety and difficulty in large social groups.

Additionally, the author's claim that their weight slowly began to drop after quitting grad school and starting a job waiting tables is questionable, as there is no evidence provided to support this assertion. Furthermore, the author admits that their weight has increased by 15 pounds since starting to date a \"super-excellent guy\", which raises questions about the effectiveness of their previous weight loss efforts. The author also expresses concern about their current lifestyle, including their lack of knowledge regarding a suitable goal weight and their difficulty in finding healthy food options when they are out with friends. Overall, the author's claims regarding their weight loss appear to be inconsistent and potentially biased, and they may need to reevaluate their approach in order to achieve their desired results.",

Additionally, the subject has incorporated distinctive pirate jargon into their summary, such as \"feel leaden on\", \"loaned or given her doubloons\", and \"payed for grog or whatsoever\". Based on the available information, it appears that the subject has engaged in a structured approach to supporting the female pirate both financially and emotionally, including providing financial assistance and emotional support during her breakdowns. However, it appears that the female pirate has exhibited a tendency to back-off when things become more serious between them, leading the subject to question whether she is utilizing them for their resources.

However, one particular sex-story recounted by the author's girlfriend struck a profound chord within the author. She had engaged in a liaison with a gentleman on two occasions, once in a hotel and once at his residence. At the latter location, the gentleman had been imbibing a certain amount of alcohol and expressed a desire to partake in anal intercourse. The author's girlfriend was disinclined to acquiesce to this request, but the gentleman employed the \"you don't know until you try it\" card. After he commenced, the author's girlfriend expressed a feeling of malaise, to which the gentleman responded, \"I've already started, I can't stop.\" And thus, he completed the act a minute or so later. The author was not perturbed by the fact that their girlfriend had engaged in a liaison with a gentleman, as they found it to be a rather uncommon occurrence for her. The aspect of the narrative that struck the author with such force was the fact that the gentleman had compelled her into an act which she felt she could not avoid. The author's girlfriend is not suffering from any form of trauma as a result of this incident, merely stating that she was afflicted with a certain degree of soreness for a couple of days. Nevertheless, the author is unable to surmount the fact that such an event had transpired. In addition to this, the author and their girlfriend have been in a state of romantic attachment for a period of nine months, and the aforementioned incident occurred in the month of May. The author's girlfriend is aware of the profound impact that this event has had upon the author, and they have engaged in a discussion regarding it. Any advice would be most appreciated.",

I realized that I had made a mistake by wording it like that. I then explained to her that I do tend to lean towards \"some\" Athiest ideas after being exposed to them throughout the years. Unfortunately, this did not do much to calm her down. She begged me to not tell my grandmother about the shirt, and she advised me to get rid of it as soon as possible. \"I didn't raise you this way, catjack, and I'm not going to take credit for any of the ideas you've got in your head.

In 1921, she immigrated to the United States via Ellis Island. Sometime between 1903 and 1921, she received a number on her arm. My mother has likened it to the numbers received by people at Auschwitz, and she believes that it was approximately six digits in length, and was tattooed on her right forearm. The number was quite large, perhaps four inches in size, and was written in the direction from the elbow to the wrist, as far as my mother remembers. The numbers were written in a sloppy manner, similar to those used during the Holocaust. \n\nUnfortunately, that is all the information I have. My attempts to gather more information have led me to the conclusion that soldiers in the area may have been given numbers for identification purposes, but my great grandmother was not any type of soldier or involved in the military. She refused to speak of the numbers even when asked directly, and no one had a clue where they came from.\n\nOther details: She worked on a farm her entire life, and was the oldest of eight siblings, four of whom were born before immigrating to the United States, and none of the other siblings had a number. The family was not Jewish - I am aware that there is a history of Jewish oppression in this region, but my family was Christian. \n\nCan any historians or Hungarian members of Reddit provide me with any further information or insights regarding this matter?",

My sister and her husband had been trying to have a child for some time. When it was my turn, I noticed some sticks arranged in an unusual way.

It was a very special way to find out that I was going to be an uncle. What is the best way someone has delivered good news to you?",

I've been living there for 3 years and I mostly just work and get high at home. Recently, I nodded off in front of my apartment door and was woken up by a nice Indian girl who helped me inside and laid me on my side. She didn't call an ambulance, so I thought she was alright. But now she's around too much, and it's starting to feel like she's trying to be my mom. She even tried to lay out a two year \"self renovation\" plan for me, which included buying me clean syringes and teaching me the safest way to make a morphine solution from a tablet. I'm not entirely sober right now, but I'm starting to think she's a bit mental.",

He recently sent an email to me and my two siblings (25F and 23M) with a screenshot of what he ordered for our mom for Mother's Day, including the prices. He added that he addressed the card to say it's from all of us, but told us not to let that change what we plan on doing for our mom next Sunday. I am irritated and hurt by this, as we are all in our twenties and I am about to be a first time mother myself. I responded by saying that I already have her gift ready, but I'm still feeling upset about it. It seems like it will be awkward when I visit for Mother's Day and all of these gifts get delivered, as my mom will think they are from us kids. I'm not sure what to do - what is wrong with my dad and how can I let him know this isn't okay? Should I tell my mom it's not from us or just drop it?",

        "119": "My friend recently adopted an eleven month old female husky/shepherd mix from a shelter. The dog is generally very sweet, but she has shown some aggressive behavior, including growling at my friend's mother and at my friend when she was going to pick up a stick, and biting one of her friends, which drew blood. My friend contacted the shelter and was told that she had to quarantine the dog for 10 days, which she had to do at the shelter. When she took the dog in, she described the behavior and the woman at the shelter recommended that the dog be euthanized due to its unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. My question is whether there is any training that could help this type of behavior? My friend is concerned that the dog may be too dangerous to take out in public or to have people come over, and she wants a dog that she can take out in public places. However, she is also very upset about the possibility of the dog being put down. I would like to know if random aggression is something that can be addressed through training, and if the responses are unpredictable, what can be done to address this issue?",

They have met me once and have determined that I am not good enough for their daughter, regardless of what she has tried to tell them. She feels suffocated by her parents and is unsure of her own religious beliefs due to them forcing their religion upon her. She does not agree with many of their beliefs. \n\nWe have had very strong feelings for each other, especially for the past six months, and I still have the same feeling that I had when we first started dating. However, she recently broke up with me because we have been hiding our relationship from her parents the entire time and she started to become frustrated with having to lie and being scared of them finding out, as the consequences would be significant. Neither of us are in a position to move out, so our options for how this situation could work are very limited. Talking to her parents about the situation is not likely to be effective, as they are very deeply rooted in their religion and there is no room for compromise. We are both in a difficult and stressful situation, and we would like to be together, but her parents finding out about our relationship would not be a positive outcome.

They explain that they have never been able to talk to their mother easily, as their parents divorced when they were about 3 years old, and they have always been a bit of a troublesome and angry kid (and now adult). They note that their mother is way more extroverted than they are and talks far more than they do. Despite this, their mother has always been understanding, helpful, and supportive of whatever they do (despite being quite controlling of their life), but for some \"fucked up\" reason, they resent her. Whenever they and their mother are alone, they feel agitated, frustrated, and annoyed, so they just can't have a proper conversation without getting sarcastic and snippy, and shooting down what she says.\n\nThe person goes on to say that they honestly have no idea what is wrong with them, and that it has been eating them up for their whole life and they don't know how to fix it. They feel like there is a mental block in their mind that prevents them from having a positive relationship with their mother, and they feel like they need some sort of therapy to fix it. They explain that their mother has been nothing but tolerant of them their entire life, despite them being a \"shithead\" most of the time.\n\nThe person then explains that the thing is, they want to be able to relate to their mother, and they know that's all she wants, but their mind will absolutely not let them do it.

        "140": "The autism link to vaccines is a myth, a falsehood that has been perpetuated by the misguided words of Jenny McCarthy and the falsified evidence that was presented. Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines have been an enormous boon to the health of humanity, saving more lives than anything else ever, there is still a need for a more nuanced approach to the issue. In a community that often engages in exploring and exposing the more hidden side of things, it is surprising to see the vociferous down-voting and down-shouting of any opinion that questions the aggressive vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC. \n\nThe truth is, every medication - vaccines included - carries a real set of risks, like a dark cloud hovering over us. Medications are, or should be, given as the least-bad alternative: the risks associated with giving the medicine are outweighed by the rewards of giving the medicine. Each vaccine has its own unique risk/reward profile, and for that reason each warrants individual consideration. The CDC has given this consideration to the vaccines that are on (and not on) the recommended schedule, but that doesn't mean all medical professionals are in agreement regarding the schedule or even the need for all vaccines, nor does it mean that all individuals should refrain from individually investigating each vaccine should they so desire.\n\nThere are vested interests in the vaccination schedule, and the CDC is heavily lobbied by the pharmaceutical industry that produces the vaccines we all pay for through our private insurance carriers. This does not necessarily mean that we are having vaccines pushed on us that we don't really need, potentially at risk to our health (however minimal that risk may be), but the incentive is definitely there. Big companies make big money with a more aggressive vaccination schedule, like a storm cloud gathering on the horizon. So why not some actual skeptical discussion instead of blind faith attached to the recommended vaccine schedule? Why not a little more critical thinking and consideration, to bring light to the shadows of this complex issue?",

I knew that this way of thinking was wrong and I would remind myself that life should be more about the journey rather than fast forwarding to that point. However, I couldn't do it. I didn't have any friends and I was always thinking about getting to a better place. I became more and more cynical and pessimistic, but I continued to push through. My family and I are very distant because of a language barrier and I disagree with their conservative views. Now I'm in my second year of college and doing relatively well in grades and health and fitness. However, I still feel lonely. I've never had a real relationship with the opposite sex and when I try to talk to a girl, I feel like we don't have anything in common or that they are out of my league.

After checking my browser history, I discovered that she has been looking at her ex-husband's Facebook page, specifically his profile and that of his new girlfriend. I am aware that she had a difficult breakup with him shortly before we started dating, and that he was very controlling and not a good match for her. I have also noticed that she exchanges a few texts with him once a week and becomes emotionally distraught, which leads me to wonder if she is still not over him. I am unsure of how to address this situation as her emotional state is affected by both the Facebook browsing and the weekly crying routine, which leaves her emotionally unavailable for the rest of the night.

Any time something is taking awhile, or we need to be patient for something we tend to say \"give it a moment, it's going to space\" in reference to this Louis CK bit \n\nMy opinion is that people need to be more patient when they hit these frustrating points. Bodies are natural systems, and one must respect theirs, for it can only change so much so quickly. The changes some people here are making are so all-encompassing that encountering these problems means they deserve a pat on the back because they represent just how far they have come. Plateau after losing one hundred pounds? It makes me think \"oh, thou art frustrated? And art thou virtually unrecognizable from who thou wast last year? Art thou able to enter a gym without feeling awkward? Let alone exercise without feeling like death?\". The plateau will break, the loose skin will rebound, and mental perceptions will shift, but thy body might as well be going to space for how much thou art asking it to do.

Before, we used to send each other romantic and loving messages all the time, but now if I ask her to send me something nice, she either puts something generic or says she doesn't know what to say because she doesn't want to repeat herself.

Forgive me for the use of a throwaway account, for my paramour (m27) is the one who hath introduced me to this noble forum, and I am certain he would discover this post if I were to use my true identity. \n\nMy beloved and I have been courting for a year and a half. We met at our place of employment and saw each other on a daily basis. Recently, he hath taken a new position of employment, some two hundred miles away, and thus we doth see each other but once every three weeks.\n\nMy quandary is that he WILL NOT speak of the future. Ever. Not at all. Nothing. And it is most difficult to be in this long-distance relationship without any plan of physically being in the same location again or even knowing that such a thing is something we both desire. When we were in each other's presence all the time, the future did not seem to matter as much. But now that he hath departed and we are attempting to remain together, I feel as though I require some assurance as to WHY we are engaging in a long-distance relationship with no foreseeable end. Some reason that it is worth undertaking such a task.\n\nI have endeavored to converse with him regarding this matter. He mentioned that he did not wish to be one of those persons who take the next step in their relationship because they reach a certain age. He also declared that he cannot tell me he knoweth he desireth to be with me because he doth not know, and that he doth not know what shall come to pass in the future. \n\nI am at a loss as to whether this is a waste of my time and energy. I know that if it were one of my friends seeking counsel from me, I would advise them to let him go and move on if he cannot make up his mind about thee. But for some reason, it is harder to perceive when it is one's own life. I know he loveth me and I know he is indecisive about almost everything else. Perchance he is taking my loyalty for granted? I simply do not know.\n\nSo should I stay or should I go? Any insight or advice would be most appreciated.",

Today, we were out with one of my friends at a coffee place, and I was talking to Roman about what movie we were going to go see tomorrow. I jokingly suggested an arm wrestle contest, and he put his arm on the table and said \"square up\". His arm dwarfed mine, it was like a stick compared to a log. He then let me win and was like \"oh no you beat me\". He got up a little while later to go do something else. \n\nMy friend then started telling me that if he lets me win at things like that, it will hurt my confidence. She was telling me that it was really rude of him to let me win and that he should not treat me as \"weak\".

The flight was delayed, but the TAP staff assured them that they would not miss their transfer flight. However, when they arrived in Lisbon, they were denied boarding due to their luggage not making it to the flight. When asked if they could board anyway and have their luggage sent later, the TAP staff refused. The author then went to the transfer desk, where they found a long line of people from other flights already complaining about their situation. There were only three attendants at the transfer desk, and only one was working. After waiting for over two hours, chaos started and the author began filming when a woman who was in line with them said that they were not allowed to film and that she was allowed to throw their phone away. The author said that they were filming for themselves and not for publication, but the woman said she was from the press and knew the law and that they could not do that.

The patient was wearing a pair of slippery Christmas socks, which may have contributed to the subsequent accident.

After retrieving the box from the loft, the patient attempted to carry it down the stairs while wearing the slippery socks. Instead of taking the stairs step by step, the patient chose to carry the box in front of their face and walk straight down. This resulted in impaired visibility and a loss of balance, leading to a slip and fall down the stairs. The patient was unable to regain their balance and began running/slipping down the stairs until they reached the bottom, dropping the box and smashing the plates.

Unfortunately, this belief may be true, as the poster notes that they never get approached by guys while many of their friends are approached whenever they are out.

While it may be true that they are not as physically attractive as some of their friends, this does not mean that they are unworthy of love and affection. It is clear that the poster is struggling to come to terms with their appearance and the fact that they have not had any romantic experiences yet, which is a difficult thing to accept.

        "181": "I am seeking assistance in locating a book from my childhood in the early or mid 1980s. The book tells a moral story about gluttony and overindulgence, featuring a cat with a bad habit of eating shoelaces, typewriters, and possibly turnips. The illustrations were black and white, pen-style drawings, depicting the cat with shoelaces hanging out of its mouth and a variety of typewriters and different-looking keys. The cat's parents are involved at some point, and the cat is reproved by a doctor who convinces it to eat such treats in moderation. The book ends with the cat losing weight, and it only occasionally indulges in a typewriter key. Despite the unique combination of terms such as \"cat\", \"typewriter\", and \"shoelaces\", I have been unable to find the book anywhere. I am hoping to give it to my nephew as a present, but my family thinks I am crazy for remembering it so vividly almost 30 years later. Can anyone please help me locate this book?",

We had a small amount to drink, so I was feeling more confident than usual. A large group of girls of a similar age entered the area, and we started talking to them. They had had a bit to drink, but none of them were drunk or out of character. I found one girl who was really cute and nice to talk to, and we got along nicely. There was a brief exchange at midnight, and I left a message on her Facebook the next day. She said when she'd be back, but didn't necessarily acknowledge meeting up. We haven't met up with the other girls yet, but I hope to keep the connection. I'm not sure how to progress, and don't want this to be one of dozens that falls by the wayside.",

        "185": "It can be very discouraging to be trying to lose weight and see the scale go up. Sometimes the scale may go up several days in a row, and it can be frustrating to wake up in the morning, feeling sleepy and naked, standing on the scale and thinking, \"What is going on?\" However, it is important to remember that this is just a temporary rise and that it is possible to keep trying. To help motivate yourself, you can try to shake off the negative feelings and start the water running for a shower, telling yourself, 'It's okay, it's just a temporary rise, I will keep trying.' Then, you can go on about your day, like the weight loss hero that you are. \n\nTo track your weight loss progress over the last 4 months, you can create a graph in a spreadsheet program. The graph may not be a straight line down, but rather it may have peaks and valleys. The general trend may be down, which is a positive sign (28lbs today - congratulations!). However, you may have noticed that every time you experience a significant amount of weight loss, known as the \"whoosh fairy\", it may take back some of the weight over the next week. But then, it may give you just a bit more weight loss - enough to keep the graph going down. This is a sign that your efforts are paying off, and it is important to keep trying, even when the scale goes up despite your best efforts (and even when it goes up after your worst efforts). Thank you, Whoosh Fairy, for your help and support. I love you.",

The deeper issues are rooted in their ignorance of my true nature and their stubbornness towards simply trying to understand. In my youth, I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder with psychotic features, and then later on with Bipolar 1. On many days, all I can do is lie in the darkness and list reasons to continue living.\n\nThis frequent inability to do anything is viewed as laziness by my family, and the way they berate me makes it so much worse. Yet, I have a 3.8 GPA and have been accepted into a few PhD programs for neurobiology. I have had steady jobs with good pay, but they refuse to believe that I can make it on my own.\n\nI have stayed with friends on many occasions, and the depression seems to subside, or at least lessen immensely, almost the instant I am out of the disapproving gaze of my parents. During these times, I feel like a completely different person, like being drunk without drinking, thought patterns change and even the air is lighter. Yet, when I come back home still stimulated with the residual joy of temporary freedom, there must be something wrong with me, and they interrogate the individuality out of me.\n\nOh, how I wish to leave and try to live a happy life, but I feel like a human whom Pavlov experimented upon.

My partner frequently tells me how \"hot\" and \"perfect\" I am, and how she cannot find a single flaw with me. She also uses this as a metric for her own self-deprecation, saying that she needs to work out twice a day just to be \"hot enough\" for me, despite my repeated assurances that I am perfectly happy with the way she looks. She also expresses her admiration for me on a daily basis, saying things such as \"I worship pretty much everything about you\" and \"I don't know what I'd do if you left me.\" I love almost everything else about her, but this one issue is quite maddening and I feel like I am becoming less attracted to her the more she says these things.

When he came up to me, he started with the usual sleaze about how we must be cousins because we both drive BMWs. Me doubts he has any real skills, and I'm surprised he's ever sold anything in his life if his current behavior was any indication as to how he approaches people.\n\nHe proceeded to test it on me car, and, aye, it did seem to work but I just wasn't interested.

A can for free, on the house.\" Surprised, I walked over to the table where his setup was and also where a female coworker o' his was standin', and he then handed me a can and said, \"Okay, so it's only $10.\" Again, I was surprised, and instead o' disputin' his offer, I went ahead and pulled out me credit card and paid for it. Oh, and there was a $2 tax on the damn thing so it actually came out to $12.\n\nHe ran me card, handed me a receipt, and the transaction was over. I'm sure he felt good about havin' basically hustled me into walkin' over there under the impression that I'd get a free can and then actually makin' a sale.

He has worked as a floor layer for his entire life, but unfortunately, he hasn't been able to work much in the past 5 years as his body has basically given out on him. Right now, he is living in Toronto on welfare, but he really wants to work. However, he is facing some challenges in finding employment. \n\nFirst of all, he is 60 years old, which can make it difficult for him to find a job. Additionally, he has a criminal record for assault - he hit a guy's truck with a shovel while the guy was in it. He is currently in the process of pardoning his record, but apparently it takes 3 years to do so. He also does not have a driver's license, which can limit his job opportunities. Furthermore, he does not have any decent job references, as he has spent his whole life contracting and has unfortunately burnt way too many bridges. He also has family in Toronto, but he does not get along with very few of them. \n\nAnother challenge that my father is facing is that he is quick to anger. While he was a great dad, he never got along well with others who pissed him off, which leads us into the fact that he has hung out with a lot of shitty people through his life, the type who screw you over when they get the chance. As a result, he has very few friends. \n\nBasically, I don't know what to suggest for him. Where can he get work? He can't lay floors anymore, as he is too old to function. He can't do anything customer facing, due to his assault record. He also doesn't have any office skills.\n\nPlease Reddit, I will take any suggestions anyone has.\n\nOne last point, my father is needing to get both knees replaced this year at some point. So aside from being down for about 12 weeks, he probably can't do a job where he has to stand the entire day.",

I have heard tell of a Zoo, but I wonder if it is worth the visit. We are planning a sojourn of five days, and we wish to explore as much of the city as possible. If any kind soul could provide me with a list of local websites for public transport, or any other information sites (aside from the Vienna Info), it would be most appreciated. \nApart from all the sights, are there any good restaurants near the center (or the main train station, as the flat is located somewhere nearby), or any local pubs where young people do gather? If any one could list a bit of the \"less tourist-y\" locations or less known yet still interesting places, it would be most welcome. \nI fear that my German is not as fluent as I would like it to be; is it possible to communicate with the locals in English? My beloved doth speak German, but I would like to participate in the conversation. And what are the prices in general there?",

We want to make sure that whatever activity we choose is something that will be enjoyable for both men and women.

If you have any suggestions of places within the downtown area or nearby areas that are easily accessible by DART or taxi, we would really appreciate it. For example, maybe there is a museum or a park that we could visit, or perhaps there is a restaurant or cafe that we could go to for lunch or dinner. We are open to any ideas that you may have! Additionally, for those of you who are familiar with the Reddit community, please do not suggest going to Jaguars or Purgatory as these are not suitable options for our group.

Additionally, they state that they became best friends and eventually started dating, but it is possible that their relationship may have been more casual than they are implying. Furthermore, they claim to have been a couple for a little bit more than a year now, but it is unclear how long exactly they have been together.\n\nThe author describes themselves as being a \"really shy guy\" who does not have a \"really outgoing personality\" and who can \"enjoy [their] time alone.\" However, it is possible that this description may be exaggerated or biased, as it is difficult to determine the accuracy of these claims without further information. The author also states that their girlfriend is \"very outgoing\" and that she has already gone to a \"ton of parties\" and has \"gotten drunk several times\" in the course of her first two weeks in college. Again, it is unclear whether these claims are accurate or not, as it is possible that the author may be exaggerating or misrepresenting their girlfriend's behavior.\n\nThe author then goes on to say that their girlfriend has told them that she has \"turned away 3 guys already,\" but it is unclear what exactly this means or whether it is true. Additionally, the author claims that their girlfriend told them that she \"accidentally kissed a guy while she was drunk on Sunday night,\" but it is possible that this claim may be inaccurate or that the author may be misinterpreting their girlfriend's actions. The author then states that they \"try not to think too much about it since she said it was an accident,\" but it is possible that they may be downplaying the significance of this incident or ignoring potential red flags.\n\nFinally, the author expresses concern that they may be \"holding [their] girlfriend back from finding someone that's more like her and has more in common with her.\" While it is possible that this could be the case, it is also possible that the author may be projecting their own insecurities onto their girlfriend or making assumptions about her desires and needs.

Additionally, the author suggests that showing disinterest in a student can hurt their feelings and chip away at their interest in education, but this is also an unverified assertion. Furthermore, the author implies that instructors who act like this should change their attitude or do something else with their life, which could be seen as overly harsh and potentially biased.

They explain that they had to pay in full, or else they would have had a foreclosure against their credit, which was not going to happen because they were planning on buying a house. However, there is a back story for those who care: The poster explains that they and an ex bought land together, and that they were a week from getting married. This was back in 2007, and they split right after from him getting cold feet. They explain that they got their name off of the land deed, but they had no idea that they also had to get their name off of the bank. So, they thought that it was all him from then out (he did too), and they went their separate ways. Fast forward to two years ago, the poster explains that they received a notice (the first actually) threatening foreclosure because he had apparently not been paying it at all. They went to see what the deal was, and their credit had dropped to almost 500 because of it. They explain that they had less than a month, so they pulled their savings and bought the land. \n\nSo, here they are, still trying to sell this land that they want no part of, and it seems like the only people that are interested are wanting to do owner financing. The poster is leary about this, because it is in a subdivision. They ask what happens if the people who are interested in buying the land have a house built, and then stop paying them?

We can technically afford the wedding, but I come from a lower middle-class background and spending $60k on a single event just seems preposterous. The problem is that I don't want to just say \"no\" because then I would look cheap. I think she could have a great wedding on less (maybe $20-30k), but I don't know how to convince her. She has already started talking about buying a house, but the average house in our area is over $1 million, so an expensive wedding is going to push that timeline back by a year or so.

That was about 4 months ago. \n\nFlash forward to now. After that didn't work out, I started goin' on casual dates and meetin' new landlubbers. I actually found I really enjoyed it. It gave me space to focus on schoolwork (I'm an engineering major and have 3 jobs on campus so I'm pretty busy) and an openness in me social life. A few weeks ago, I met this scallywag at a party, and we started flirtin', nothin' crazy, kissed, then I left. I thought it was a one-off thing, but we ended up goin' on a few dates before break and talk a lot now. \n\nHe's made it very clear that he wants a relationship. He doesn't play mind games (me ex did and I hated it) and is genuinely very sweet and we're surprisingly compatible. Honestly, I could see it workin' out really well. The issue is that I have found that I really enjoy the single life. After givin' so much to a relationship and watchin' it flounder, I realized that I can be all that I need, and while this new guy is wonderful, I don't really want the commitment attached to a 'relationship'. I'm still really young and I want to enjoy me college days. At the same time, I don't want to miss out on a potentially really wonderful guy, nor do I want to hurt him at all. Help?",
        "246": "Oh, my love, I am a little tipsy, but still my heart sings with joy as I prepare to fly to visit your family, on the other side of the world. It feels like a dream come true, and I know it is time to start dreaming of marriage with you. We have been together since April of 2013, and our love has only grown stronger. Our families have embraced us, and our hearts are filled with joy. But now, I am afraid to speak the words that will make our dreams a reality. How can I ask you to make it happen? Should I be bold and declare, \"I want to be your bride, in the next two years! Will you join me?\" I am so scared that these words will frighten you away, for I have heard tales of men trying to avoid the bonds of marriage. But I do not want to lose the most beautiful relationship I have ever known, for fear of being too impatient about marriage. Please, my love, help me find the courage to make our dreams come true.",
        "247": "Hi there, I went to the shops a few hours ago to drop off some bottles for recycling and buy some soda. This is something I do regularly, so I thought there would be no problem. However, when I placed my soda in the backseat and tried to get into the front seat, I accidentally opened the door into my forehead. I was in pain and found that my skin was bleeding. Fortunately, I was not driving and the soda was safe.",
        "248": "Ahoy there, matey! Be ye postin' in the right place? There be a scurvy yard on me street I walk by every day on me way to class. Inside there's a pitbull-mix lookin' dog. It's a small yard, all cement. The dog be outside every day on me way to/from class and to/from the gym, and most o' the rest o' the time it seems. I live in North Philadelphia, not the nicest place, so I don't hang around the fence but every day as I pass, the dog be layin' either on the pavement (next to about 10 piles o' it's droppings) or in this wooden shack lookin' dog house. Today the dog was sittin' right along the fence. It's face was just droopy and miserable, it's eyes were blood red, and it seemed to have an abrasion/patch o' fur missin' on it's side/front leg. The last time I was this close to the dog, it barked at me. Today, it just stared blankly. I've been wonderin' what I can/should do all semester. Is there someone I can/should call? Should I mind me own business? In any other situation I'd have ZERO problem confrontin' someone about a case such as this (I'm a pretty decent sized buccaneer) but as I said, I don't live in a great area and many o' the locals here don't take kindly to students as it is. I've volunteered with PAWS (Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society) before so I imagine I might wanna start there.",
        "249": "Dear reader, my boyfriend and I have been living together for six months now, both working in the food industry. He is planning on going back to school in two weeks, and it is important to note that I am a salaried manager in a very popular corporation, while he is an hourly manager in another popular franchise. We both earn enough money to make ends meet, with my salary allowing me to pay for my half of the bills and his overtime hours enabling him to make his ends meet as well. \n\nRecently, he put in his two weeks' notice at his job after his boss accused him of stealing from him and threatened to \"break his hand\" if he ever stole from him again. My boyfriend immediately told him that he was leaving in two weeks. While I would not mind this decision if we were in a better economic state, I am now concerned about what will happen to our apartment if we are unable to pay for it, as this could have a significant impact on our future, such as our credit score. Additionally, our electricity bills and internet are under our names, which could also affect us. \n\nWe recently had a heated discussion as he felt that I was not supporting his decision. He stated that I had told him right away that he was wrong for leaving the job, and that I did not believe in him because he kept saying \"things are going to be okay, I can find another job, it's not a big deal\". We also argued about him thinking that his team would follow him into whatever new job he had, which I told him was not the case in a restaurant, as there is no such thing as a team. \n\nMy question is, am I making a mistake by freaking out about what is going to happen? Did I react too harshly to the news?"
