I have an ongoing medical issue I am trying to work out with my doctors and specialists, and I let my GF know if I've made an appointment regarding something that has happened recently because I think she at least deserves to know im going to the doctor because (insert reason) happened. Most of the times I tell her this, she tells me what she thinks is wrong with me and sometimes will suggest that I do 'X' whether that is take some over the counter drug, insist that my doctor ruin some test or even to the point one time where she will try to get me to take a prescription drug prescribed to her mom for the issue that she thinks I also have. I am not OK with doing things outside what my doctor recommended. Because of that I will usually get defensive as i am not asking for help, just letting her know I am going to the doctor and we argue about it. She does have some medical background in regards to sports related injuries, but is not a doctor trained in what my doctors think is wrong (gi issues). How can I communicate about this without being confrontational, or am I in the wrong for getting defensive ( totally fine with that if it's the case ). I also want to note that I do go to the doctors when something is wrong regardless of what it is, not the type to hold out for long.\n\nSummary:",

We really started talking since we both do the same school activities and now I'd say we are really good friends, as scary as that sounds.

Whenever we sit next to each other or walk side by side we tend to playfully \"bump\" into each other and when she gets tired she would link arms with me or rest her head on my shoulder. I'd say these physical notions suggest that she's interested in me, but I wouldn't know otherwise because I've never asked her. I've given her notions that I like her but I don't know if she ever picked up on that. \n\n Now that I've gotten to know her some more, I'm beginning to fall for her more and more and the thought of us being together makes me joyous but I don't know if she feels the same about me.

Which only frightens me more because if that's the case then there's no telling how far that denial could extent. This mostly concerns me because of how defensive he is of the subject, and why he would not be willing to admit that any emotions were involved considering they now have a close friendship. Or at least it was close until he began to date me and she dramatically lessened her communication with him.\n\nIs it possible to have sex with someone emotionlessly who you shared 5-8 years of your life with, lived with, grew up with, and at one point cared enough about to tattoo their initials on your body? If you don't think so, any suggestions as to how to go about this already tense topic and try to uncover his real feelings? Or maybe I shouldn't do that? I'm very confused and nervous.\n\nSummary:",
