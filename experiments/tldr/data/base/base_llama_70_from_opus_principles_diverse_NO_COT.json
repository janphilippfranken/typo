This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.\n\nThe plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? \n\nI am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??\n\nSummary:",
            "response": "The post is about a long-distance relationship and a trip planned for the summer. The original plan was for the poster to fly to the west coast to meet her boyfriend, but her mother was worried about her going alone, so they decided to road trip together. The poster booked a flight back from the west coast to the east coast, where her mother would pick her up and they would fly back to the UK together. However, her mother got mad at her for booking the flight, even though she knew about the trip and the poster had done everything she could to make her feel comfortable. The poster is fine flying alone and doesn't understand why her mother is trying to sabotage the trip.",
