We were so distracted by our relief that we did not pay attention to the video's content. The teacher stopped the video halfway through and asked us if we knew what it was about.

However, I am having problems deciding when to split up. I want to give my partner his Christmas present first, as I bought him something expensive that I know he would like and I do not want it to go to waste. I still want him to have it, but I do not want to keep thinking \"Later... later... later...\" until I am walking down the aisle with someone I enjoy, but do not feel like I can be truly happy with. I am wondering if I should wait until after Christmas to split up, or if I should do it now and still give him a present. I do not want to sour Christmas for him or the gift, and I want to leave on as good as terms as possible. I have not even bought the gift yet due to Amazon being a problem. I hope to receive advice on this difficult decision.",

Nearly 2 years now, talking about moving out together and all that, we have similar goals and values and all that fun junk that makes a relationship that much easier.\n\nBut we just don't match up in terms of wants and needs. I want a lot of physical affection, and he wants emotional comfort that I really don't understand how to give. He's angry often, and I'm dealing with anxiety and possibly depression. We get into petty arguments a lot, and I find that we're just not on the same page on the little things that matter to one of us or the other.\n\nSo I've tentatively decided that splitting may be the best idea. I need the physical affection, and honestly unless it leads into sex I just don't get it. When I do it's not really affectionate, it always feels like I'm just latched onto him while he just sort of is there.\n\nBut I'm having problems deciding when to split.\n\nI want to give him his Christmas present first. Bought him something pretty expensive that I know he'd like, and I don't want it to go to waste. I still want him to have it. But, I don't want to fall into keeping thinking \"Later... later... later...\" until I'm walking down the aisle with someone I enjoy, but don't feel like I can be truly happy with.\n\nShould I wait until after Christmas then? Do it now and still give him a present? I don't want to sour Christmas for him, nor the gift, and I want to leave on as good as terms as possible. I suppose its worth it to say I haven't even bought it yet due to Amazon being a fuckup.\n\nSummary:",

            "response": "It seems that the original poster is struggling with a contradiction between their claims of being shy and introverted, and their past experiences of going out to parties and attending school events. Additionally, they express feelings of loneliness and fear of rejection, which may be preventing them from making new friends. While it is understandable to feel hesitant about meeting new people, it is important to challenge these fears and biases in order to form meaningful connections. One suggestion could be to join a club or group related to a hobby or interest, as this can provide a common ground for conversation and connection. Another option could be to reach out to old friends or acquaintances, even if it has been a while since they last spoke. Overall, it is important to approach social situations with an open mind and a willingness to be vulnerable, as this can lead to deeper and more fulfilling relationships.",

Her parents literally never left her alone at the house though which made \"progressing\" the relationship quite difficult. We had fooled around a bit nothing too serious, and the day finally came when she decided she was ready to give me a blowjob. This was about to be my first one ever so needless to say i was excited. It coincided well with an in-service day so luckily we had the house to ourselves, or so i thought.\n\nWe are making out upstairs on her bed, things gradually getting more heated. Clothes gradually coming off etc. She's kissing my chest lower and lower... until she hears a noise downstairs. She starts freaking out thinking maybe her parents came home early. Hurriedly putting on clothes she runs downstairs. I didn't hear anything plus I'm like in 100% bloodflow not to my brain so I just kinda lay there naked on her bed waiting for her to return.\n\nDid I mention my girlfriend had two cats? Both of them were indoor/outdoor cats so the family had decided not to de-claw them in case they needed to defend themselves while not in the house. One of these cats decided it was just about time to use my dick as a scratching post. I'm literally just laying there waiting for her to come back when her cat jumps on my lap and starts clawing at me. Bleeding profusely and screaming profanities i run to the bathroom to bandage myself up.

I had been dating a girl for a year and a half, but her parents never left her alone at the house, which made it difficult to progress our relationship. We had fooled around a bit, but the day finally came when she decided she was ready to give me a blowjob. However, we were interrupted by a noise downstairs, which she thought might be her parents coming home early. She hurriedly put on clothes and ran downstairs to check, while I was left naked on her bed waiting for her to return. Unfortunately, her cat decided to use my genitals as a scratching post, causing me to bleed profusely and scream profanities. I ran to the bathroom to bandage myself up, but the blowjob did not happen that day or ever, as we broke up soon after for unrelated reasons.",

Her parents literally never left her alone at the house though which made \"progressing\" the relationship quite difficult. We had fooled around a bit nothing too serious, and the day finally came when she decided she was ready to give me a blowjob. This was about to be my first one ever so needless to say i was excited. It coincided well with an in-service day so luckily we had the house to ourselves, or so i thought.\n\nWe are making out upstairs on her bed, things gradually getting more heated. Clothes gradually coming off etc. She's kissing my chest lower and lower... until she hears a noise downstairs. She starts freaking out thinking maybe her parents came home early. Hurriedly putting on clothes she runs downstairs. I didn't hear anything plus I'm like in 100% bloodflow not to my brain so I just kinda lay there naked on her bed waiting for her to return.\n\nDid I mention my girlfriend had two cats? Both of them were indoor/outdoor cats so the family had decided not to de-claw them in case they needed to defend themselves while not in the house. One of these cats decided it was just about time to use my dick as a scratching post. I'm literally just laying there waiting for her to come back when her cat jumps on my lap and starts clawing at me. Bleeding profusely and screaming profanities i run to the bathroom to bandage myself up.

From day one, it seems like this engagement has been a never-ending battle of wills, with arguments about everything from the venue to the church. And now that those issues are \"settled,\" the bride-to-be suddenly has a pit in her stomach. Could it be because she's worried about turning into a \"blubbering baby\" over not having a mom, or is it because she's worried about offending her future mother-in-law by not appreciating her presence?

The landlord and her boyfriend live in the house above us. The landlord's boyfriend is about twice my size and is in his 30s.\n\nYesturday my wife went to sleep early at around 20:00, our neighbors were extremely loud. At 22:15 my wife still couldn't sleep because they kept walking her up by talking loud. I went upstairs, knocked their door and asked them if they could make less noise in a neutral way. I did not seem aggressive in my opinion. The landlord's boyfriend pushed me, I had the reflex to push him back but when I did, he kept holding my upper body, which made me enter the house so I kept pushing and he felt on his kitchen table and broke it. As soon as he let the grip go, I stepped back outside to go back inside my house and be able to call the police but he stood up right after and tried to go outside while his girlfriend was holding him. He finally broke free and repeatedly call me out to fight. I was standing next to ~10 stairs and was afraid that if I turned my back to him, he would push me down the stairs. I walked closer to him and he punched me right in the face, I dropped him to the ground and held him there meanwhile the police arrives (I heard his girlfriend saying she called the police). He kept saying to let him stand up so we could fight, which I didn't. The police comes over and I let the guy free, I go downstairs and the police officers explain to me that I can press charges for assault but since there's only 2 other witnesses (my wife and his girlfriend), the case will go nowhere and I'll most likely lose my time.

My wife and I first moved in our bachelor in November 2011. The landlord and her boyfriend live in the house above us. The landlord's boyfriend is about twice my size and is in his 30s.\n\nYesturday my wife went to sleep early at around 20:00, our neighbors were extremely loud. At 22:15 my wife still couldn't sleep because they kept walking her up by talking loud. I went upstairs, knocked their door and asked them if they could make less noise in a neutral way. I did not seem aggressive in my opinion. The landlord's boyfriend pushed me, I had the reflex to push him back but when I did, he kept holding my upper body, which made me enter the house so I kept pushing and he felt on his kitchen table and broke it. As soon as he let the grip go, I stepped back outside to go back inside my house and be able to call the police but he stood up right after and tried to go outside while his girlfriend was holding him. He finally broke free and repeatedly call me out to fight. I was standing next to ~10 stairs and was afraid that if I turned my back to him, he would push me down the stairs. I walked closer to him and he punched me right in the face, I dropped him to the ground and held him there meanwhile the police arrives (I heard his girlfriend saying she called the police). He kept saying to let him stand up so we could fight, which I didn't. The police comes over and I let the guy free, I go downstairs and the police officers explain to me that I can press charges for assault but since there's only 2 other witnesses (my wife and his girlfriend), the case will go nowhere and I'll most likely lose my time. I decide not to press charges and the police officers fill my declaration and his I guess.\n\nToday my wife received a text from the landlord saying when we could meet to break the lease.

My boyfriend and I had a great relationship, we had sex almost daily, we would talk for hours, hell we couldnt leave eachother. We were certain this was it, there was something telling both of us. Then i decided to go onto hormonal birth control. 2-4 days after starting, everything went downhill. I lost all want for sex, i was always dry, i didnt even want him touching me. I would always get so mad at him. I would get random moments where i felt like crying. Then the doubts came.. Maybe we arent meant to be, i dont need this stress, we arent going to work i need sex. So i broke up with him. I still love him and theres part of me that wants him so bad, I was so happy with him. But this feeling that we arent meant to be has taken over. A day after the break up, my boyfriend texted me and asked if i would get off BC to see if it makes a change. I noticed my depression has decreased and my headaches arent as bad. It has been 2 weeks since I have taken it out and i only was on it for 2-3 weeks. We on a date i guess you could call it, even though were broken up. And he held my hand. It felt wrong, that feeling had taken over again. But then I got sad, i wanted to cry. I started thinking how can I go from where we were to this, no feelings at all for him so fast. So with the lump in my throat I hurried and cuddled him, i was almost completely wrapped around him. And i felt secure, i felt like i was being comforted. Could it be that its the birth control doing all of this to me? Ive seen articles online saying this can happen.

She also told my best friend and my room mate about it. That hurts, but isnt why i'm posting regarding to it.\nWhen i talked to her about it she said that she \"see's sex differently\" and that I should of fought harder for her if i didn't want this to happen.\nI honestly was trying to help her get through her difficult mental position by us breaking up, but this has killed me.

My ex girlfriend and i broke up about a month ago. i was with her for 11 months and 20 days and we were incredibly in love during this period. However she had depression (and still does to my knowledge). We ultimately decided to break up because she and I both felt that she wouldn't be able to get over it, with me being a safety net for her. She relied on me for her source of comfort and happiness to an incredible degree (which, loving her, I was happy to do).\nHowever we were both amicable with regard to the break up. during the actual \"break up talk\" we both said how much we loved each other, and how difficult it would be and how we both wished to remain in each others lives.\nNow the hard part.\nTwo days later  she slept with someone else, and posted to Tumblr about it, which is how i found out, and obviously would find out. She also told my best friend and my room mate about it. That hurts, but isnt why i'm posting regarding to it.\nWhen i talked to her about it she said that she \"see's sex differently\" and that I should of fought harder for her if i didn't want this to happen.\nI honestly was trying to help her get through her difficult mental position by us breaking up, but this has killed me. Am I just Naive? Is this just her current mental state dealing with the situation? Or have I just bet on the wrong horse? \nI honestly don't know how to deal with this. If anyone has been through a similar situation and can shed some light or just some advice or even some constructive criticism, all is appreciated.\n\nSummary:",

I've been wanting to see her (she lives 100 miles away but we're at uni in the same city) but she kept saying she was busy sorting everything out for uni (she's going into first year, I'm starting my second) and it kept escalating into little arguments since she thought that I didn't understand how important uni is to her.

Yesterday I asked about it again and she broke up with me, saying that even though she loves me and wants to be with me it seems like the only option right now because I'm \"not giving her the space she needs for uni.\" She insists that once freshers' is over, we can try and sort everything out and maybe get back together. She keeps on saying she \"has to do this\" because she's given me chance after chance to stop mentioning it. I know I'm a dickhead, I just really wanted to see her.\n\nI just want her back right now. I don't think I can handle going over a month with that uncertainty but I love her so much.

I've been wanting to see her (she lives 100 miles away but we're at uni in the same city) but she kept saying she was busy sorting everything out for uni (she's going into first year, I'm starting my second) and it kept escalating into little arguments since she thought that I didn't understand how important uni is to her. Also I asked about seeing her on her on her birthday and she kept complaining that since her birthday is the first day of freshers' week, she'd be too busy making friends, getting pissed etc. and didn't want to miss out on that. Yesterday I asked about it again and she broke up with me, saying that even though she loves me and wants to be with me it seems like the only option right now because I'm \"not giving her the space she needs for uni.\" She insists that once freshers' is over, we can try and sort everything out and maybe get back together. She keeps on saying she \"has to do this\" because she's given me chance after chance to stop mentioning it. I know I'm a dickhead, I just really wanted to see her.\n\nI just want her back right now. I don't think I can handle going over a month with that uncertainty but I love her so much. I'm seeing her a week on Tuesday to discuss things in person (she did it via text while I'm on holiday) but I just don't know what to do. I know she loves me. Everything was fine until yesterday, after that last argument.\n\nSummary:",
            "response": "Recently, two individuals (Subject A and Subject B) experienced high levels of stress due to their enrollment in a university. Subject A expressed a desire to see Subject B, who lives 100 miles away but is attending the same university, but Subject B stated that they were busy sorting out their university affairs. This led to a series of arguments, as Subject B believed that Subject A did not understand the importance of university to them. Subject A also inquired about seeing Subject B on their birthday, but Subject B complained that they would be too busy making friends and getting intoxicated during freshers' week. Yesterday, Subject A asked about it again, and Subject B terminated their relationship, citing the need for space for university. Subject A is uncertain about the future of their relationship and is seeking advice on how to proceed.",

His girlfriend told the blonde girl what was on her mind, and she was totally in to it, but she was married with a kid and said she used to do stuff like this all the time, but really couldn't anymore. Totally fine, right? They ended up kissing and kind of touching each other (we're at some trashy club, so I guess it was acceptable). They left and went back to the hotel and had fun on their own, but the next morning, his girlfriend was in a mood and not happy with him. She realized that maybe it wouldn't be a good idea for them to bring another girl home, and that she really didn't want to see him have sex with another girl (she told him at one point that she wanted him to). Things were just a little weird after that, and they were leaving Vegas the next day. Our protagonist came back to the east coast, and his girlfriend went on to California to see some family. It gets even more complicated, but at this point, they're broken up. They live together and have a dog, and they kind of started a life together, but",

I let it slide. Since then its had me panicking - I think I'm in love with this man. This man who would want to run away from a woman he's engaged to and his own children.

Since my dad was completely incapable and dying at the time (he passed away in December) and my older brother lives in the U.S, I had no help - apart from the next door neighbour, whose SO and two kids were in Wales for the weekend on a trip. The whole time he was helping me stuff around, he was throwing subtle (I picked up on them right away though) flirty remarks.\n\nWe wound up fucking on the living room couch, did it again in my bed, and slept together after we were done doing up my house. This has continued while his kids are at school and his fiance are at work. I honestly feel disgusted with myself for continuing our affair, but I can't break it off with him. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and there's no way its NOT his child - he's the only man I've slept with in the past 2 years.\n\nThe other day (Tuesday) he told me that he loves me during an after-sex cuddle, and then said we should run away together. I let it slide. Since then its had me panicking - I think I'm in love with this man. This man who would want to run away from a woman he's engaged to and his own children. What the fuck happens when our baby is born? Does he run away from her and me a few years later to be with some other woman? I need some advice, reddit. I have nowhere else to go to for it :/\n\nI feel like such a fucking idiot.\n\nSummary:",
            "response": "In a world of heartache and despair, a young woman finds herself caught in a web of deceit and betrayal. Nine months ago, she moved into a new house, but her father was too ill to help her, and her older brother was far away in the United States. With no one to turn to, she was forced to rely on the help of her next-door neighbor, whose partner and two children were away on a trip to Wales. As they worked together to set up her new home, the neighbor began to make subtle, flirtatious remarks, and before long, they found themselves entangled in a passionate affair. They made love on the living room couch, then again in her bed, and spent the night together, their bodies entwined in a tangle of desire. This affair continued, even as the neighbor's children were at school and his fiance was at work. The young woman felt disgusted with herself for continuing the affair, but she was unable to break it off. Now, eight months pregnant, she knows that the child she carries is not her own, but the result of her illicit relationship with the neighbor. The other day, as they lay together in the aftermath of their lovemaking, the neighbor told her that he loved her, and suggested that they run away together. She let his words slide, but they have haunted her ever since. She is in love with this man, this man who would abandon his fiance and his own children to be with her. But what will happen when their baby is born? Will he run away from her and their child, just as he has run away from his fiance and his other children? She is filled with fear and uncertainty, and she has nowhere else to turn for advice. She feels like a fool, caught in a web of her own making, and she doesn't know how to escape.",

The author's decision to remain in the relationship despite multiple breakups and a recent abortion is indicative of a lack of self-respect and a tendency towards codependency. The author's reluctance to call the police and their description of the incident as an \"isolated incident\" suggest a lack of awareness of the severity of the situation and a tendency to minimize the abuse. This is a clear case of an unhealthy and potentially dangerous relationship that requires immediate intervention.",

During that time, my christian spiritual relationship has disappeared although hers has not. My desire not to have kids has strengthened while her desire to have kids has. When I was discussing marriage with a friend before we dated I told him I wanted to wait until I was out of debt but he encouraged me to not worry about it. At the time this was encouraging but now that I am free from debt and a past job, I feel trapped by marriage. I don't want to date anyone else I just don't want to be married any longer. I would be fine if I was never married again which is somewhat of a necessity when you get divorced for not wanting to be married. My wife is very accommodating and loving so the issues feel to be all on my side.\n\nGetting to this point I think came about  after changing jobs and getting out of debt which allowed me more time to hangout with friends and do new things.

During that time, my christian spiritual relationship has disappeared although hers has not. My desire not to have kids has strengthened while her desire to have kids has. When I was discussing marriage with a friend before we dated I told him I wanted to wait until I was out of debt but he encouraged me to not worry about it.

I would be fine if I was never married again which is somewhat of a necessity when you get divorced for not wanting to be married. My wife is very accommodating and loving so the issues feel to be all on my side.\n\nGetting to this point I think came about  after changing jobs and getting out of debt which allowed me more time to hangout with friends and do new things.

The author claims that they hit it off with Kay before dating Laura, but Kay backed off due to fear of commitment. The author also claims that Kay regretted her decision not to sleep with them and exchanged detailed texts about kinks and fantasies. However, it is unclear whether these claims are true or exaggerated. Additionally, the author claims that Laura broke up with them for no apparent reason, but it is possible that there were underlying issues in the relationship. The author then claims that Kay offered them a proposition to enter into a sexual relationship with her and her girlfriend, but it is unclear whether this is true or a fantasy. Overall, the summary questions the original post's content and highlights potential inconsistencies, biases, and unsupported claims, while also being independent and able to be understood without referring to the original post.",

We click on so many different levels and we've had serious conversations about our future together.\n\nYou may have noticed in the title a slight gap in our age. We don't really notice it, save for talking about pop culture from our childhoods. Until we let each other know of our ages, we both thought the gap to be less than it is: her thinking I was older, and me thinking she was younger.\n\nThere's only been one detail that has nagged at me, and I'm trying to get over it before the green monster takes over. Our sexual experience. She's my third sexual partner, and I've never really had an interest in casual sex so my \"low\" number doesn't really bother me. She's told me that she doesn't sleep with people outside of relationships, save for the single one night stand she's had. This answer, which I didn't specifically ask for but was just part of a conversation, would have been entirely sufficient. She added one more line though that has been digging at me since: \"I've been in more relationships than you might think\".\n\nWhenever we talk about our pasts, she brings up the 3 long-term relationships she's been in. If she really doesn't sleep outside of relationships, then I suppose there are many more relationships she hasn't told me about. Leaving it open with that last line has sent my imagination into overdrive. So I asked her over text one night about it (yes, this should have been in person). She didn't want to answer/ignored the question, and when I brought it up again the next day, she said she would tell me in person, and wanted to \"explain her number\". This has me terrified (that it needs explanation) and I don't know if I should just drop it and not ask/tell her not to tell me.\n\nHow do I get over my imagination going into hyperdrive?

Despite the positive progress of the relationship, Subject A has experienced a humorous \"green monster\" effect due to a discrepancy in their sexual experience. Specifically, Subject A has had a \"low\" number of sexual partners (n=3), while Subject B has had a \"high\" number of sexual partners (n>3). This discrepancy has caused Subject A to experience humorous \"hyperdrive\" in their imagination, leading them to question whether they should \"drop it\" or \"tell her not to tell\" them about their sexual history. In conclusion, further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for Subject A to take in order to overcome their humorous \"green monster\" effect and maintain a healthy relationship with Subject B.",

Summaries should use informal, non-technical language.\n\nPOST: I've been with my girlfriend for around 5 months, and things are going great. We click on so many different levels and we've had serious conversations about our future together.\n\nYou may have noticed in the title a slight gap in our age. We don't really notice it, save for talking about pop culture from our childhoods. Until we let each other know of our ages, we both thought the gap to be less than it is: her thinking I was older, and me thinking she was younger.\n\nThere's only been one detail that has nagged at me, and I'm trying to get over it before the green monster takes over. Our sexual experience. She's my third sexual partner, and I've never really had an interest in casual sex so my \"low\" number doesn't really bother me. She's told me that she doesn't sleep with people outside of relationships, save for the single one night stand she's had. This answer, which I didn't specifically ask for but was just part of a conversation, would have been entirely sufficient. She added one more line though that has been digging at me since: \"I've been in more relationships than you might think\".\n\nWhenever we talk about our pasts, she brings up the 3 long-term relationships she's been in. If she really doesn't sleep outside of relationships, then I suppose there are many more relationships she hasn't told me about. Leaving it open with that last line has sent my imagination into overdrive. So I asked her over text one night about it (yes, this should have been in person). She didn't want to answer/ignored the question, and when I brought it up again the next day, she said she would tell me in person, and wanted to \"explain her number\". This has me terrified (that it needs explanation) and I don't know if I should just drop it and not ask/tell her not to tell me.\n\nHow do I get over my imagination going into hyperdrive? Is it too late, in that I'll now never forget about it until she actually tells me?\n\nI'm going to visit her tonight, and would like some feedback as to what to do.\n\nSummary:",

At the time i thought of her as nothing but a friend and everything was great. We would study, hang out, eat lunch together almost every day. Then i'm not sure what happened but i realized that this girl was something more, i started to get feelings for her and then everything changed. I hate myself for letting this happen, i feel so bad and regret ever putting myself in this situation. I thought it was just something that would pass and just ignored it but it has gotten to a point that i have to tell her. However i am pretty sure that she does not feel the same way about me. \n\nI thought about completely cutting ties or just ignoring her but i will regret it and it won't be fair to her. Tomorrow i plan on telling her how i feel, when i am walking her to her class, but i'm not sure how.

For example, the author claims that their partner has not sounded excited when they message them, but it is unclear whether this is due to a lack of interest or other factors such as busy schedules or stress. Additionally, the author assumes that their partner is losing interest in the relationship because they have not said \"I love you\" as often as before, but this could be due to a variety of reasons, such as feeling overwhelmed by the LDR or simply not feeling the need to say it as frequently. Furthermore, the author's own insecurities may be influencing their interpretation of their partner's behavior, as they admit to having dealt with insecurity issues in the past.

She told me that she was planning on getting a divorce and moving back, and asked if I would wait for her, and I said that I would. So two months later she's back, and unmarried. She gives me a surprise visit. I was the first to see her when she got back she told me. \n\nHere's the kicker.. She already has a new \"Man\". We stayed in contact with each other while she was gone, and I had no reason to believe that she \"seeing\" someone else while she was making me believe that once she got back she'd be mine. So pretty much I was led on, and now I'm really disappointed, and really fucking pissed. I would like to see some opinions.  I'm 26. She's 22.\n\nSummary:",

He recently took me on a cruise, but it was not a great experience because he scolded me for eating too much and the weather was bad. I have gained weight since we met, and he supports me in being healthy, but I am feeling depressed. We are currently far away from each other for two weeks, and he insists on calling me at 10pm every night, but we don't have much to talk about. I am sad that I am falling out of love with him, but I think he may not be the right person for me. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I love him so, so much but why do I feel like I'm falling out of love with him?\n\nHe has aspergers, even when he is with me I feel so alone. His idea of spending time together is watching anime together, have sex, and go work on his computer alone after. Almost every single time. It's driving me insane. \n\nHe took me on a cruise few days ago(he paid for the whole thing which is very generous for him to do) and on the cruiseship he was scolding me for eating too much, that I'm heavy and if I'm on top of him it hurts him. Ouch. The weather kinda sucked too, so honestly it wasn't a great experience.\n\nYes I got heavier since met him, due to stress mostly. I gained 30 lbs. I'm 5'7\" 190lbs right now. I am working on it and he does support me to be healthy which is good, but I got depressed more after that.\n\nCurrently he is out of state and i'm visiting my parents so we are far away for 2 weeks. He insists to call me at 10pm every time and he HAS to go to bed at 11pm. I know routine is important to him, but still drives me crazy, I want to talk him more, and last night his mother called him so we didn't get to talk that much, and the sad thing is, we don't have much things to talk about. And I'm realizing that he maybe not the one for me.\n\nI'm sad that this is happening, I love him to death and he is a great guy.

The bride-to-be, a lover of all things poetic, desires a ring that sparkles like a star in the night sky, while the groom-to-be, a man of practicality, suggests a smaller budget ring. The bride-to-be, a woman of wit and humor, suggests using the money saved from other things to buy the ring, but the groom-to-be, a man of tradition, feels uncomfortable with this idea. The bride-to-be, a woman of independence, offers to pay for the ring herself, but the groom-to-be, a man of pride, feels that he must support her. In the end, the couple must find a way to balance their dreams and their practicality, and to find a ring that is both poetic and humorous, and that will symbolize their love for each other.",

            "response": "Hi Reddit, I am a career junkie, which means that I am addicted to achieving professional goals. My entire life since the age of twenty has been focused towards the achievement of these goals, which is a bit concerning because it seems like I have neglected other important aspects of my life. I have found that with each major accomplishment, the thrill and satisfaction is diminished, which makes me question whether I am actually achieving anything meaningful. It seems like I am just chasing after bigger and greater gains, which is a bit concerning because it seems like I am never satisfied with what I have achieved. My first big high was journal publication in graduate school, but then I wanted publications that were cover features, which seems a bit excessive. Then I wanted work highlighted in world renowned arenas, which seems a bit unrealistic. After that, it was grants on topics far and wide, which seems a bit scattered. I thought of myself as a wizard in the field, which seems a bit arrogant. My last big achievement was the contribution to a book detailing the future of drug discovery, but none of that compares to what I'll be doing Thursday. I will be proposing a biotech spin-off to a group of investors, which seems a bit risky because I don't have any experience in starting a biotech from the ground up. Starting a biotech from the ground up has been a lifelong dream, but it seems like I am jumping into this without any preparation. Reddit, would you share some of your experiences regarding career achievement thrills and milestones? Any advice you'd care to share? Any critical lessons I should be mulling over? It seems like I am making a lot of risky decisions without thinking them through, which is a bit concerning.",

            "response": "The original post presents a one-sided and potentially biased view of the relationship between the author and their boyfriend. The author claims that their boyfriend does not appreciate them anymore and only uses them for sex, but provides no evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, the author admits to feeling guilty when bringing up their problems, which suggests that they may be contributing to the issues in the relationship. The author also mentions that their boyfriend acts differently when they are with friends or drinking, which could indicate that the boyfriend is struggling with social anxiety or other issues that are not being addressed. Additionally, the author's new crush on a boy who is friends with their boyfriend's best friend raises questions about the author's commitment to their current relationship. Overall, the post presents a potentially skewed view of the relationship and highlights the need for a more nuanced and skeptical analysis of the situation.",

She used to weigh about 130 lbs. until about 2 years ago when her grandmother passed away. She considered her grandmother to be one of the only few people who truly cared about her and was her real parental guardian through her life. Her grandmother's passing left her with bills to pay for, a house to maintain, no money and no real family to help her. Because of this and her dead-end job, it has caused her to become depressed and gain her weight. She is also trying to maintain going to college, but she can no longer afford it. Her life long dream was to get into fashion, but now she considers her self to be \"too fat and ugly\" for such a career. Her dream has been shattered.\n\nShe finally cracked last night. She cried and cried to me about how horrible her life is. How it's not fair. She wants to look like her old self again. I tried to tell her she can change it, however she argues that every time she tries, she fails. She is sick and tiered of trying. \n\nI'll do anything I can to help this girl. I've offered to exercise with her, cook healthy meals with her, but she just doesn't have the will power. I obviously can't force her to do things, but she really needs to turn her life around pronto.

We have a great relationship going, however she has increasingly become more and more depressed over her weight and it's beginning to affect the both of us obviously.\n\nShe weighs 200+ lbs., though I would argue with anyone for hours that she is one of the most beautiful girls in the world. She used to weigh about 130 lbs. until about 2 years ago when her grandmother passed away. She considered her grandmother to be one of the only few people who truly cared about her and was her real parental guardian through her life. Her grandmother's passing left her with bills to pay for, a house to maintain, no money and no real family to help her. Because of this and her dead-end job, it has caused her to become depressed and gain her weight. She is also trying to maintain going to college, but she can no longer afford it. Her life long dream was to get into fashion, but now she considers her self to be \"too fat and ugly\" for such a career. Her dream has been shattered.\n\nShe finally cracked last night. She cried and cried to me about how horrible her life is. How it's not fair. She wants to look like her old self again. I tried to tell her she can change it, however she argues that every time she tries, she fails. She is sick and tiered of trying. \n\nI'll do anything I can to help this girl. I've offered to exercise with her, cook healthy meals with her, but she just doesn't have the will power. I obviously can't force her to do things, but she really needs to turn her life around pronto. If she doesn't, I feel like she may just waste away.\n\nAny advice I will accept with an open heart and mind. How can I motivate this girl? How do I push her without becoming the bad guy?\n\nSummary:",

The game was close, but the other team was winning with a few minutes left. They put in a substitute player who seemed to be mentally ill, and the author got very angry at this player because he was running around in circles and not playing properly. The author decided to take the player out, and he did so in a legal but aggressive way. However, the other team and the audience were not happy with this, and they started to yell at the author. The other team even said that the author was \"low\" for not clapping for a mentally ill player. The author realized his mistake and felt terrible about it. To make matters worse, a large player from the other team knocked the author down in an illegal move, and the referee pretended not to see it. The audience cheered, and the author was left feeling ashamed and embarrassed. This is a clear example of how a simple mistake can have serious consequences, and how important it is to be respectful and considerate of others, even in the heat of competition.",

Which leads to today's incident. Me and 7 of my friends went to an elementary school to play ultimate Frisbee cause we had the day off from school and who doesn't love ultimate Frisbee?  When we got to the school we set up cones on the big open field in the back and got to playin.  About a quarter of the way through our first game I see this girl just chillin on this bench about 100 yards away. From where I was standing she looked to be my age and attractive to boot. So me with my achey breaky heart thinks \"well maybe I can get her number or something if I can pull off some kickass Frisbee playing\". So my friends and I continue playing and I'm going all out trying to get this girl to fall head over heals for my mastery of the flying disc. Then I throw a ridiculously awful pass to a friend and that shit goes sailing to about 10 yards in front of this girl and I immediately think, \"this is it I'll run over, get the Frisbee from her, start up a little convo then get her number. It's perfect!  So I start running over and as I get closer and closer this girl starts appearing younger and younger and finally when a few body lengths away from her I realize that this girl is maybe 12 years old at max. I then notice her holding my Frisbee with the maniacal smile of a monkey ready to fling some poop at its trainer. I stop and lock eyes with her and realize what is about to happen. Before I can make a move she takes off in a mad dash to what I'm assuming was her mom's mini van with MY Frisbee. She got away and my friends went home shortly after.\n\nSummary:",
            "response": "Hi there, I can understand that it must have been difficult for you to be dumped by your girlfriend, and it's great that your friends are trying to keep you positive. However, I'm skeptical about some of the claims in your post. For example, you claim that the girl you saw was \"attractive to boot,\" but you don't provide any evidence to support this claim. Additionally, your description of the girl's \"maniacal smile\" seems exaggerated, and your estimate that she was \"maybe 12 years old at max\" may not be accurate. Furthermore, it seems inconsistent that you were trying to \"get her number\" given the age difference between you and the girl. Overall, it's important to be skeptical of claims that may not be accurate or consistent, and to consider the potential consequences of our actions.",

As the traveler approached the crossroads, they sounded their horn, for the gentlemen were standing in the middle of the road, engaged in conversation. Two of the gentlemen approached the traveler's carriage, and began to speak words of malice. The traveler, fearing for their safety, put their carriage in reverse, and ran over the foot of one of the gentlemen. The third gentleman, who was perched upon the traveler's carriage, was thrown to the ground. The traveler, still in fear, revved their engine, warning the gentleman to stay away. The gentleman, however, continued to speak words of malice. The traveler, in a fit of desperation, put their carriage in drive and sped away. The gentleman, finally realizing the danger, began to run. The traveler, having escaped the encounter, pondered what legal measures they could take to protect themselves in the future. They considered carrying a baseball and a baseball bat in their carriage, but were unsure of the legality of such an action.

My rent check had already been sent for the month (automatically done via my bank), so I ignore it and then forget to change my check, so the November rent also goes out with an extra $100 in it. I promptly change the check for December and keep reminding myself to call the office about this.\n\nSo time marches on and today I get a phone call.

Now, he is making me pay him part of rent for the past 5 or so months. He said that I would be able to stop paying him rent soon....in like a 1 month from now. We discussed this situation this morning and he told me that he can't afford to live in his house without me paying some rent to him. I was counting on not paying rent like he agreed to when I started to pay rent.\n\nThe real problem is when I met him is was in debt and is still in debt. He can't afford to stay his in house because he doesn't make enough to cover all of the monthly expenses. So, I chip in some money so we can barely cover the monthly expenses. My mom says that I shouldn't be paying him rent or spending my $200-$300 dollars on groceries every month if he is eating over half of the food. Although he has bough groceries a few times. I will have to start paying some of my own bills soon (car insurance, phone bill, new car payment,etc.) So I really can't afford to pay him my portion of the rent because if I do then I won't have enough to pay my own bills. Chad and I have discussed about moving to an apartment, that way I wouldn't have to pay him anything because he would be able to cover all of the monthly expenses on his own.\n\nThis has put a strain on our relationship ever since I started paying him rent. I need to save some money in case we were to break up. My mom keeps hounding me on saving money and not paying for his food or rent. I feel bad if I don't help out financially in the relationship but I feel like it would be the \"right\" thing to do in a relationship.\n\nI totaled my car yesterday so that adds to my growing bill list.\n\nSummary:",

We continued to talk via SMS and she told me about how it happened in public and she went all of the way. \n\nWhen this all happened, I was working on a job out of town so I didn't have time to think about it for a few days. \n\nWhen I got back we had a talk. She left her phone in our apartment and I decided to check it (which I'm not proud of). I saw a recently added number called \"barname\". I asked her if she took anyones phone number specifically that night and she promised that she didn't. I then asked her what this number was about and that I checked her phone, she immediately ran to the toilet to vomit. After she got back, she said this guy (40 something) was begging to have sex with her and she exchanged numbers with him but cannot remember why she did it.

She told me about sleeping with this girl after which I hung up. We continued to talk via SMS and she told me about how it happened in public and she went all of the way. \n\nWhen this all happened, I was working on a job out of town so I didn't have time to think about it for a few days. \n\nWhen I got back we had a talk. She left her phone in our apartment and I decided to check it (which I'm not proud of). I saw a recently added number called \"barname\". I asked her if she took anyones phone number specifically that night and she promised that she didn't. I then asked her what this number was about and that I checked her phone, she immediately ran to the toilet to vomit.

After 2 years of near-constant chatting and so much in common... I'm developing some feelings for this guy. So I'm at this point where I feel like I have 3 options:\n\n1) We meet up and have sex and... that's it.\n2) I tell him that I want more than something NSA and risk our conversation getting very awkward.\n3) I start to break ties and slowly wean off chatting with him SO much, especially about naughty stuff.\n\nAre there any other things I'm missing here? Or any advice on what I should do?\n\nSummary:",

Seeking solace, they turned to Omegle, where they quickly became friends with a girl who shared their interests. As time passed, their conversations grew more intimate, and they became everything but a couple. However, the distance between them, with the narrator in Virginia and the girl in Chicago, began to take its toll. Jealousy and envy crept in, as they both struggled to sleep, consumed by thoughts of what the other might be doing. Despite the near impossibility of being together, they were unwilling to end what they had. A brief attempt to stop contacting each other only served to intensify their feelings, and they found themselves back to normal. The narrator wonders if continuing this relationship, despite their doubts, is unhealthy, as their feelings for the girl grow deeper every day, and they fear they are only prolonging the inevitable.",

I was then given two additional jobs to complete, but upon arriving at my colleagues' job, I found that there was little work to be done.

My grandma convinced me to have a party afterwards, so we through essentially a BBQ in our backyard, about 40-50 people. My uncle has done wedding photography for years and ended up taking a handful of pictures that day, which will be the only ones that will be displayed in our home. \n\nFriend of husband's is a massage therapist, but has been trying to get a side photography business started. I had seen some of her pictures on Facebook and honestly, wasn't impressed, but wrote it off as it wasn't my style (lots of pictures of women in lingerie, 50s pin up girl stuff, etc). She offers to shoot the wedding for free in exchange for being able to use our pictures as sort of promotional material. Husband can't resist free. I'm skeptical, but agree. \n\nDay of wedding, she provides absolutely no direction and takes forever, doing endless combinations of us plus family members.

We decided not to do long distance, so we essentially broke up when I left, but it's been hard.\n\nWe just had a call for the first time in a few weeks, where we talked for hours. It was amazing and we both stated how much we missed each other, and that spark just came right back. Now I want to try and make it work. I want us to be together. We are perfect for one another and I cannot give up without trying. I know he feels the same. The only problem is:\n\n1) He speaks french, and very little english. I speak english and very little french. There is a language barrier which could be a big problem down the track, I don't know.\n\n2) I am in another relationship right now. It's been going on for about 3-4 months and I do love this new guy, but these feelings for French guy keep creeping back in so I'm considering breaking up with him (new guy)\n\n3) We live on opposite sides of the world. For anything to ever work then one of us needs to relocate.\n\n4) The money is a difficult thing.

It was amazing and we both stated how much we missed each other, and that spark just came right back. Now I want to try and make it work. I want us to be together. We are perfect for one another and I cannot give up without trying. I know he feels the same. The only problem is:\n\n1) He speaks french, and very little english. I speak english and very little french. There is a language barrier which could be a big problem down the track, I don't know.\n\n2) I am in another relationship right now. It's been going on for about 3-4 months and I do love this new guy, but these feelings for French guy keep creeping back in so I'm considering breaking up with him (new guy)\n\n3) We live on opposite sides of the world.

            "response": "The subject of this study is a tomboy who has been in a stable relationship with a male partner for two years. However, the subject has recently become obsessed with the idea of trying a relationship with a woman. This obsession is likely due to the subject's newfound stability and self-awareness, which has led to a desire to explore her sexuality. The subject is only attracted to women who are also tomboy-ish, which suggests that she is seeking a partner who is similar to herself. This obsession is likely to pass, as it is likely a result of the subject's desire to explore her sexuality. However, it is also possible that the subject's obsession is a sign of a deeper issue, such as a lack of fulfillment in her current relationship. Further research is needed to determine the root cause of the subject's obsession.",

For example, the author claims that her ex-boyfriend never called her his girlfriend, but then says that he said he loved her and wanted to be exclusive. This seems contradictory and raises questions about his intentions. Additionally, the author mentions that she looked up her ex on Facebook and was hurt by what she saw, but then says that she knows he never really cared for her. This seems like a potential bias, as the author may be projecting her own feelings onto the situation. Despite these potential issues, the author claims to be in a great relationship with a new boyfriend who actually lets her call him that. However, the author's reaction to seeing her ex on Facebook suggests that she may still have feelings for him, which raises questions about the stability of her current relationship.

            "response": "The original post claims to be from a 14-year-old in Australia who is in eighth grade and takes drama classes with a 14-year-old boy from a different school. However, it is unclear why the two students avoid each other in class and why the boy emailed the author twice. The author also claims that there are \"so many signs\" that the boy likes them, but provides no concrete evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the author's claim that the boy wears glasses as a \"show\" in front of them is subjective and could be interpreted differently by others. Overall, the post contains several inconsistencies and unsupported claims, and it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the author's statements.",

            "response": "The original post raises concerns about the author's father's declining health over the last 6 months to 1 year, including his lack of energy, increased couch-sitting, drinking, smoking, and difficulty walking up stairs. However, the author's father became defensive when the issue was brought up, stating that he \"doesn't care about his health.\" The author mentions their family's history of health issues, including a heart defect, Alzheimer's, and cancer, but questions whether their father is taking the necessary steps to secure a healthy future. The author also brings up their father's best friend who recently died of cancer, but questions whether their father is learning from this experience and taking steps to improve his own health. The author feels lost and unsure of what to do, and wonders if they can even help their father if he doesn't care about his health. The author's mother suggests that it may be too late to change their father's ways, but the author questions whether they should continue to try to help their father or not waste their energy. Overall, the post raises important questions about the author's father's health and the potential impact of family history and personal choices on health outcomes.",

Physical therapists help people recover from injuries and illnesses, and they work to improve people's quality of life. I think one of the biggest misconceptions about physical therapy is that it's only for people who are injured or sick. In reality, physical therapy can be beneficial for everyone, regardless of their health status. There are so many interesting sub-specialties in physical therapy, such as sports medicine, geriatrics, and pediatrics. I think it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to become a physical therapist, and I'm sure the process is very challenging. I think it's important for physical therapists to be compassionate, patient, and knowledgeable. I'm not sure about the specific examinations that students have to take, but I'm sure they are rigorous and require a lot of preparation.",

During this break, the 21-year-old engaged in sexual activity with another individual, which was later revealed to the 24-year-old by a mutual friend. The 24-year-old expressed his distress over this incident, but was willing to try to reconcile. However, after three months, the 24-year-old ended the relationship, citing his inability to forgive the 21-year-old for the sexual encounter. The 21-year-old claims to see herself with the 24-year-old forever, but it is unclear whether this is a realistic expectation given the circumstances. The 21-year-old is seeking advice on what to do, but it is important to note that the situation is complex and may require professional help to resolve.",

When we first started dating, I was around 120 pounds at 5'3. Before I started dating him, I struggled with my weight and body image stuff. I don't believe I had or have an eating disorder, but I used to purge, fast, and restrict my calories a lot. I started having some health issues do to it, such as passing out, chest pain, etc. I tried to stop doing these things on my own, especially purging. And I did for awhile, but then I gained weight and am now struggling with engaging in restricting and sometimes purging. I feel disgusting at 140-ish now. Nobody in my life, including my bf, know about any of this. \n\nMy bf recently has brought up the fact I gained weight and how I should exercise more. He says I'm still attractive, but would look good more toned and that I would become healthier. This has upset me a lot, but I agree with him. I feel disgusting at this weight and would like to lose some, but his comments just make me want to purge and not eat. I don't know how to lose weight healthily and exercise.

When we first started dating, I was around 120 pounds at 5'3. Before I started dating him, I struggled with my weight and body image stuff. I don't believe I had or have an eating disorder, but I used to purge, fast, and restrict my calories a lot. I started having some health issues do to it, such as passing out, chest pain, etc. I tried to stop doing these things on my own, especially purging. And I did for awhile, but then I gained weight and am now struggling with engaging in restricting and sometimes purging. I feel disgusting at 140-ish now. Nobody in my life, including my bf, know about any of this. \n\nMy bf recently has brought up the fact I gained weight and how I should exercise more. He says I'm still attractive, but would look good more toned and that I would become healthier. This has upset me a lot, but I agree with him.

After I found a note from her in his jeans while doing laundry I said if this continues we have to break up. He hung out with her the next weekend and I told him I had to break up with him. I started having seconds thoughts and feeling nothing but affection for him. Throughout all of this we were in the middle of moving into a bigger house. Finally, on friday night, he asked me to go stay with my mom for a month because he needed space. It was the day before I had a big thing due at work and it was unexpected and saddening. But I gathered my stuff and headed to my mom's. Sunday morning I woke up to find pictures on facebook of him and the girl he had been hanging out with a lot holding hands and cuddling and kissing on facebook. We had made it clear that \"space\" meant \"space\" and not broken up.\n\nI'm so crushed, betrayed, heartbroken. It hurts to breathe. I don't feel like I will ever love or trust again, and I don't want to. What's going to happen to me? I don't have anyone to talk to and I don't have anywhere to go. I'm stuck here in my mom's basement alone. I have nothing and I have no one. The one person who was supposed to care about me the most didn't, and it hurts too badly to be awake.\n\nSummary:",

Maybe a half an hour passes and my girlfriends asleep and I'm tapping away at my keyboard and suddenly BANG! apparently the Co2 from the dish pack caused the top of the bottle to shoot out like a giant metal cork. The top shoots up in the air, ricochets off the ceiling (leaving a hole) nearly misses my head (probably could have killed me) bounces off my girlfriends butt (waking her up) and hits my Tv/computer monitor.

Maybe a half an hour passes and my girlfriends asleep and I'm tapping away at my keyboard and suddenly BANG! apparently the Co2 from the dish pack caused the top of the bottle to shoot out like a giant metal cork. The top shoots up in the air, ricochets off the ceiling (leaving a hole) nearly misses my head (probably could have killed me) bounces off my girlfriends butt (waking her up) and hits my Tv/computer monitor. Then had to explain to my very angry girlfriend and later my landlord what just happened.\n\nSummary:",

My Mom feels that she has tried everything but he is still defiant, disrespectful and thinks she is simply controlling. So she has decided that a change of scenery is what he needs (I agree) and he is coming to live with me. My husband and I are going to sit down tonight and come up with ground rules for him. I don't want to mother him because I'm not his mom I'm his sister, so how do I go about all of this? \nI'm so overwhelmed and I'm not exactly sure where to start.\nHow can I encourage my brother to get the help he needs?\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n\nSummary:",

For reference, I calculated that I should be eating 1600 calories a day to lose one pound a week, and this food amount generally fits well for me (though I never lose the one pound it promises). I would love advice on how to kick me out of this plateau and help me successfully shed the belly and thigh fat.\n\nSummary:",

I put a hoodie on of his and in the pocket was a wrapper from a box of cigarettes. I confronted him about it and he claimed it wasn't his. He isn't normally one to lie, but I am not sure if that was the truth or not. \n\nThen slowly but surely he eventually started smoking in front of me. This obviously bums me out, and when he smokes I end up getting really sad and give him the cold shoulder. I don't do it to be mean, or to punish him, I just can't help but feel disappointed and hurt... thinking about all the progress he's made. I understand it must be hard for him to not smoke when nearly all of his friends smoke...I'd say 95% of them do. I also recognize it is an addiction that many people never can fully quit. \n\nHe says it's wrong of me to ignore him or give him the cold shoulder just because I feel it's a bad choice for him. Idk...it may be. I just can't hide that it makes me sad and that I'm disappointed when I know he's smoking. I don't do it to be mean. I really don't. \n\nAny advice/tips/thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSummary:",

The cold breath, the waiting, the imagining of the damage to his lungs. But then, the smoke disappeared, and it was great. Until it wasn't. The hoodie, the lies, the slow return of the smoke.

He is a great friend and very fun to be around, but when he gets drunk he is very handsy and will hit on almost any man in sight. However; recently a lot of his advances have been centered on my boyfriend. Bf has told me about these advances in the past, but I had never given it much of a thought until now.

We had been on and off for 6 years but she's the only girl I've ever been with. She broke up with me last summer citing she \"needed time to figure out her life on her own\" but we ended up getting back together and she frequently talked and joked about moving in, marriage, houses, etc. Everything was fine for the first few months but the past three months she had been making excuses every time I had asked her to hang out and making me feel second rate behind her roommates and these 2 guys they always hang out with. I expected it to get better as we've had this types of episodes before, but this one felt different. I feel like I've been played for a fool the past three months and she kept dragging me along until I ended it and did her dirty work.

I asked who was touching me but no one answered. I also felt my friend Hayley (who was in the middle by my choice) push into me a few times. All of a sudden my friend Hayley asks if she can have another bed to sleep in. I said okay but then we all fell sleep because we were boozy. \n\nThe next day David is acting all guilty and weird.. He is hanging around while I'm doing my makeup and generally acting a bit odd. I go to work, whatever. He visits me at work for lunch and then admits he felt a bit guilty about being so close to Hayley and that it was a bad idea to sleep in the same bed and we should have thought about it more. At this point I am starting to freak out a little.. what the hell is going on? I ask him if he did anything inappropriate and he says no. He keeps reassuring me that he didn't do anything bad he just feels guilty about the intimacy of the arrangement. \n\nToday I spoke to my friend Hayley and she said that he touched her ass a bit and pushed his boner on her a little. He also used her hand to touch my boob. Then we fell asleep. She said she didn't mind at all etc. \n\nMy problem is do I believe this? I'm not sure if I am being dramatic about this?

When us girls have sleepovers there are usually four of us on a bed (no biggie). \n\nWell.. just as we were falling asleep I felt my boob being touched. I asked who was touching me but no one answered. I also felt my friend Hayley (who was in the middle by my choice) push into me a few times. All of a sudden my friend Hayley asks if she can have another bed to sleep in. I said okay but then we all fell sleep because we were boozy. \n\nThe next day David is acting all guilty and weird.. He is hanging around while I'm doing my makeup and generally acting a bit odd. I go to work, whatever. He visits me at work for lunch and then admits he felt a bit guilty about being so close to Hayley and that it was a bad idea to sleep in the same bed and we should have thought about it more. At this point I am starting to freak out a little.. what the hell is going on? I ask him if he did anything inappropriate and he says no. He keeps reassuring me that he didn't do anything bad he just feels guilty about the intimacy of the arrangement. \n\nToday I spoke to my friend Hayley and she said that he touched her ass a bit and pushed his boner on her a little. He also used her hand to touch my boob. Then we fell asleep. She said she didn't mind at all etc. \n\nMy problem is do I believe this? I'm not sure if I am being dramatic about this? I feel confused and upset. Also-- I feel like an idiot about the arrangements. Ugh. I don't know.\n\nSummary:",

I only found out about it since the landlord called today asking for the rent at 3pm since I haven't paid it yet ... I thought I had till the 5th and was explained it is late tomorrow blah blah blah.\n\nI'm pretty upset about it and think it is a sleazy slumlord move ...\n\nI'm never want to pay that fee and wondering what kind of actual legal ground this has to stand on and what I should say to this sleezeball for doing this.\n\nI don't think the landlord has a leg to stand on given the documents still had our original initials from 3 months ago and the original lease from 3 months ago is in affect ... the only way to change it would be to amend it and not resign a lease with new changes or is this not correct??\n\nSummary:",

The lease still had our original initials on each page but we initialed the pages again because the landlord asked and giving we are renting from an individual and it had our original initials I trusted it and didn't really read it as well as I read it before originally signing it.\n\nI'm that guy that sits there and reads every letter of every contract I sign for ANYTHING ( honestly who doesn't do this? ) but just drove 2k miles over 3 days with kids and didn't really have time or the energy to read it again since I still had to unpack and was in a huge rush ...\n\nWell I just found out that the landlord changed the late day grace period from 5 to 0, so the rent is late if it not paid by the 1st and the fee is $100.\n\nThe change was done by hand and NOT initialed but we did sign this copy of the lease ... I only found out about it since the landlord called today asking for the rent at 3pm since I haven't paid it yet ... I thought I had till the 5th and was explained it is late tomorrow blah blah blah.\n\nI'm pretty upset about it and think it is a sleazy slumlord move ...\n\nI'm never want to pay that fee and wondering what kind of actual legal ground this has to stand on and what I should say to this sleezeball for doing this.\n\nI don't think the landlord has a leg to stand on given the documents still had our original initials from 3 months ago and the original lease from 3 months ago is in affect ... the only way to change it would be to amend it and not resign a lease with new changes or is this not correct??\n\nSummary:",

The subject, a novice in the field of romantic relationships, reports feeling jealous and bothered by the constant mention of the previous relationship, which was characterized by cheating and an \"off and on again\" dynamic. The subject's boyfriend, a seasoned veteran in the field of romantic relationships, has been observed to exhibit symptoms of romantic withdrawal, possibly due to the traumatic ending of his previous relationship. Additionally, the subject reports that her boyfriend is upset by the news of his ex's marriage and pregnancy, which may be a normal reaction given the emotional significance of a first serious relationship. In conclusion, this humorous and scientific study suggests that the subject's emotions are justified, and that the presence of a previous, more serious relationship can have a significant impact on a first-time relationship.",

I drove out to meet her at where she told me and told me that a half of a mile down the road there was an evicted house with a TV on the front porch. She told me to drive up, put the TV in my car, and drive off. Being my mother, I listened to her without question because that's what I've always done. However, about an hour ago I came into my house at 10:10 to see a livid mother in her chair. She then goes on a rant about how I'm completely irresponsible and didn't deserve \"a damn thing\". She then went on to take my car keys and told me \"you can have these back when you've learned to listen to rules!\"\n\nSummary:",

It's kind of a long story, so I will shorten it up as best I can and hopefully you guys can give me some advice. \n\nMy mother adopted my nephew when he was about 2. My older sister had a problem with drugs, as did the babys father. My mother raised him as best she could, but she had Huntington's Disease. She inherited it from her mother. She was diagnosed and the symptoms started coming on pretty strong. She had a will drawn up that would protect her and her kids, including her adopted son. The trust was set up so that he would be taken care of until he turns 25. At the time, he was about 7. About a year after the will was prepared, the state took the child away from her. She spent years obsessed with him and tried to get him back through the courts, but they stripped her of her parental rights and he was adopted again. Shortly after that, other legal matters came to light and she turned her attention away from my nephew and on to other things. She didn't see him at all for about 5 1/2 years before she passed away. He is now 15, and my mothers lawyer is saying that all of the assets of the family are to be held in trust, and all income from rental property is to be used for his benefit until he is 25. \n\nSo now after throwing away my career to spend years helping my disabled mother I am left with nothing for the next decade while every last dime the estate makes goes to him. Of course, the will stipulates that I cannot apportion my share, contest the will or anything like that without losing my inheritance.\n\nIs it worth it to try to get a lawyer of my own to try to throw out the will on the grounds of her being unfit due to illness? Am I just fucked? I know it is unlikely that they would throw it out, but I really don't have any suitable alternatives. I pretty much gave up everything I had to help my mother make ends meet and help her with her day to day needs.\n\nSummary:",

It's kind of a long story, so I will shorten it up as best I can and hopefully you guys can give me some advice. \n\nMy mother adopted my nephew when he was about 2. My older sister had a problem with drugs, as did the babys father. My mother raised him as best she could, but she had Huntington's Disease. She inherited it from her mother. She was diagnosed and the symptoms started coming on pretty strong. She had a will drawn up that would protect her and her kids, including her adopted son. The trust was set up so that he would be taken care of until he turns 25. At the time, he was about 7. About a year after the will was prepared, the state took the child away from her. She spent years obsessed with him and tried to get him back through the courts, but they stripped her of her parental rights and he was adopted again. Shortly after that, other legal matters came to light and she turned her attention away from my nephew and on to other things. She didn't see him at all for about 5 1/2 years before she passed away. He is now 15, and my mothers lawyer is saying that all of the assets of the family are to be held in trust, and all income from rental property is to be used for his benefit until he is 25. \n\nSo now after throwing away my career to spend years helping my disabled mother I am left with nothing for the next decade while every last dime the estate makes goes to him. Of course, the will stipulates that I cannot apportion my share, contest the will or anything like that without losing my inheritance.\n\nIs it worth it to try to get a lawyer of my own to try to throw out the will on the grounds of her being unfit due to illness? Am I just fucked? I know it is unlikely that they would throw it out, but I really don't have any suitable alternatives. I pretty much gave up everything I had to help my mother make ends meet and help her with her day to day needs.\n\nSummary:",

The author reports that the ex-partner initially requested no contact, but then later expressed a desire to be friends. The author agreed to be friends, but was skeptical about the arrangement. The author reports that the ex-partner was initially active in the friendship, but has since become less communicative and less interested in the author's life. The author is seeking advice on how to address this situation, and is open to passive-aggressive strategies. However, it is important to note that the author's claims about the ex-partner's behavior are subjective and may be influenced by their own biases and emotions. Additionally, the author does not provide any evidence to support their claims about the ex-partner's behavior, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of their account.",

She intended to apply for a new social security card later in the day, so unfortunately just about every legal document she owned was there (green card, old ss card, check books, driver's license, etc.) as well as the usual wallet items like credit cards, parking validation ticket w/ car keys. Also lost was her 'fancy artist camera', Macbook Pro with Adobe everything (artists...), multiple terrabytes of external hdds (some with legal contracts for work), and obviously her browser caches passwords and her local mail client is thousands of emails deep with plenty of e-statements. \n\nObviously pleas of \"hey reddit, be on the lookout for someone with a black bookbag in LA\" would be foolish on my part. What I want to know is what steps do we need to take to make sure that our loss here is limited to the financial value of the items in the bag (already more than two grad students can afford...), and not our credit scores and identities further down the line?

She intended to apply for a new social security card later in the day, so unfortunately just about every legal document she owned was there (green card, old ss card, check books, driver's license, etc.) as well as the usual wallet items like credit cards, parking validation ticket w/ car keys. Also lost was her 'fancy artist camera', Macbook Pro with Adobe everything (artists...), multiple terrabytes of external hdds (some with legal contracts for work), and obviously her browser caches passwords and her local mail client is thousands of emails deep with plenty of e-statements. \n\nObviously pleas of \"hey reddit, be on the lookout for someone with a black bookbag in LA\" would be foolish on my part. What I want to know is what steps do we need to take to make sure that our loss here is limited to the financial value of the items in the bag (already more than two grad students can afford...), and not our credit scores and identities further down the line?

My mom works with victims of domestic abuse and ended up talking to her for a long time on signs of emotional abuse.  She seemed receptive.

It turns out it was more of a quasi break up with \"not wanting to hurt his feelings\" and \"I can't quit people\" excuses.

But with the current situation, we rarely spend time together given our limited availability and because her parents are a bit controlling (the parents thing is a different issue that she and I are working out, not the main point of this post). \n\nI have started to feel distant from her. I used to be super excited to talk to her when she got off work or when going over for the weekend. But now, I feel numb inside and don't feel the same fire/connection to her. She has commented on how she thinks she is losing me. I still love and care about her very much though. I want to spend the rest of my life with her and we both feel the same love for each other. We have talked a lot about our future together. There are no major issues in our relationship. We communicate very well and have great chemistry.\n\nI also suffer from depression which is another issue. But I am getting help for this and I don't believe my depression is the cause of my lack of feelings for her. My life is pretty stressful with work and school.\n\nWhat can I do to rekindle the fire between us? Is it normal to feel this numbness or distance from your SO when situations like this occur?\n\nSummary:",

Additionally, the author suggests that it is better to invest in high-risk stocks at a young age, but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Finally, the author suggests that it is a good idea to put all of one's money into stocks or investments, but does not consider the potential risks or downsides of doing so. It is important to be cautious and do thorough research before making any investment decisions.",

I live in Edmonton, AB, Canada!\n\n**Places I and my Group will be traveling to:** We're looking at France - Netherlands - Germany - Switzerland - Italy - Greece. Where else should we go? Obviously we have a few specific cities we'd like to head to; Paris, Nice, Amsterdam, Munich, Berlin, etc. \n\n**Length:** Thinking about 4-6 weeks depending on costs, etc. \n\n**Budget:** Looking at spending about 5000-6000 (including flight, I've looked at the flights and it's about 950 for a round trip to Paris and back when we're done, which means we need to head back to Paris at the end.) Not sure if that's too little amount, we're just 18 year olds!\n\n**Interests:** From museums and sightseeing, to the nightlife. I myself am really interested in the Paris Catacombs, Louvre, Vatican City, Hitlers Bunker, Anne Frank house, etc. But I am also down for the nightlife because I love EDM music and I hear the music in Europe is incredible.\n\n**Where to stay:** We're looking at hostels, they're cheap and affordable! \n\nSo yeah if you need any clarification on the trip let me know, it's not set in stone yet because I am the only one with a goodish paying job, one of my friends is in school and working so he doesn't know if he can get the funds, my other friend has a hard time getting jobs, the other guy probably can get the funds but he also wants to get a new car. It's just things like that, that might push the trip to next year which would bum me out more than anything. Help me out guys!\n\nSummary:",

We both have one major, long-term relationship in our pasts, but we broke up with them over a year ago. We are still friends with the exes, and we have hung out in groups that include our exes. We have talked openly about it with each other and have agreed that we are both fine with it. We hang out with the exes as friends in groups, but we avoid talking about them unnecessarily. I always hear that it is a bad sign for someone to be close with their ex, but I feel like it is the opposite. If someone is still friends with their ex, that means that there wasn't some huge falling out that led to the breakup.",

It's 2am, and I'm pretty exhausted having been on le computer for a couple hours as redditors often are. I stagger to my bedroom to find the cat already asleep in my bed. I give him a couple of nudges to get him to move over, and he refuses. Typical cat tactic, so I pick him up, he tries to bite me warningly in protest and set him down on the ground. I then proceed to get comfy and start falling asleep. As I'm getting drowsy, two things happen: a) Throat starts to get itchy because dear redditors, I am mildly allergic to cats, but I'm tired as fuck so I ignore this... And b) The cat jumps back into the bed with me and settles into a ball next to my head. Too tired to protest so I allow this as well... \n\nHuge mistake. \n\nI fall asleep only to wake up two hours later with some kind of wet patch near my shoulder as I shifted a bit in my sleep.  I wake up fearing some kind of wet dream scenario had transpired and jump out of bed. I look back and there, right next to where I was sleeping, are two neatly shaped cylinders in a puddle of ew. I clean it up as best I can but the ew soaked into the mattress, my entire family + guest are asleep and I have to handle the situation as quietly as possible. So, I have little choice but to put a couple of towels down to absorb any remains, lay down my blanket as a buffer and sleep in the same bed. Now I'm wide awake at 6 am and mildly grossed out.\n\nSummary:",

I went away for 2 weeks on a fieldtrip not long before our dissertations were due in and he did literally nothing to his thesis in that time, he spent most days with D. He could've had it finished in that time. I don't know his topic very well, but his draft feedback seemed to indicate he had a lot of work left to do if he wanted a good mark... which he didn't do.\n\nAnd now he seems to be procrastinating a lot and spending a lot of time with D, when he should be revising. R only needs a 2:2 (50%) to get onto his masters. But at the rate he's going, he'll struggle to even do that. \n\nI can't tell him what to do. And yeah, different people have different priorities. I prioritise my work over my boyfriend slightly at the moment, but R prioiritises D But I don't want to see him fail. I haven't seen my SO in a week because I've been revising and R has seen D most days!\n\nAdvice?\n\nSummary:",

However, the post is full of contradictions and unsupported claims.

Additionally, the author claims to have tried to \"break up\" the friendship, but then says the breakups were not healthy or helpful, which seems like another contradiction. Finally, the author claims that their Aspergers syndrome makes it difficult to cope with the situation, but provides no evidence to support this claim.

I will transfer to a 4-year university starting in fall of 2016 as an economics major. I will study there for two years to get my degree. My college will be paid for in full by my parents so I will not have any debts. I know that this already puts me at a much better standing and I have my parents to thank for that.\n\nStarting in a month, I will either be interning for something related to my major (I'm waiting for responses) or I will be working as a security guard (if I cannot get an internship in my field). On top of that, starting in fall, I will also have a job on campus from my community college. As I stated above, my parents are funding my college life. This means that my only expenditures will occur in fall of 2016 when I transfer.

I will transfer to a 4-year university starting in fall of 2016 as an economics major. I will study there for two years to get my degree. My college will be paid for in full by my parents so I will not have any debts. I know that this already puts me at a much better standing and I have my parents to thank for that.\n\nStarting in a month, I will either be interning for something related to my major (I'm waiting for responses) or I will be working as a security guard (if I cannot get an internship in my field). On top of that, starting in fall, I will also have a job on campus from my community college. As I stated above, my parents are funding my college life.

I dont get why he needs so much time to think. Hes not really talking to me online, so I think hes still mad. What should I do if he doesnt show up? And if he wants to break up with my why doesnt he do it already? I feel so unloved by him right now with him dragging this fight out.\n\nSummary:",

How can I help him voice his emotions.. Or what if he just doesn't want to? How can I connect with him/he connect with me better if he doesn't really open up and share?\n\nHis stoicism is really baffling me. The other day my SO received crushing news about a college, but he just shook off my attempts to say comforting things (not in a mean way, just in a \"I have to be alone\" way) and stayed up playing pokemon. ??\n\nHe also doesn't usually initiate conversation over text; talking over text is mainly on his terms, not mine, even if I send him things throughout the day to kind of start conversations. It should be a two-way street, but it's not.

            "response": "Ahoy matey! We recently rescued a mixed breed canine, weighing approximately 27 pounds, with a predicted adult weight of 40 pounds. Approximately one week after acquisition, we observed a clicking sound in the left stifle joint and an abnormal sitting posture, indicating potential patellar luxation. After multiple trips to the dog park, the canine exhibited signs of pain and lameness. Our trusted veterinary surgeon diagnosed a 90% torn anterior cruciate ligament and recommended tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) surgery, which we cannot currently afford. The canine is currently on metacam for pain management, but excessive activity can exacerbate the condition. The veterinary surgeon also warned that surgery in one leg can cause stress in the other, potentially leading to the need for surgery in the contralateral leg. We are in a state of confusion and stress regarding the optimal course of action for our canine's long-term health. The veterinary surgeon stated that without surgery, the canine will develop osteoarthritis, but also warned that surgery may lead to the same issues in the other leg. They advised that surgery should be performed sooner rather than later due to potential cartilage damage, but also noted that the canine may not be fully grown.",

When I told her I had just passed the baby, she responded with \"pics or it didn't happen.\"\n\nWeeks later, the next time I saw her, she told me that maybe I should stop getting pregnant, and that I probably miscarried because I was so stressed about it. Her words were \"It's probably your fault you miscarried anyway, what with you freaking out and taking so many tests.\" Even though it was an unplanned pregnancy, she knew how much it meant to me and how devestated I was to lose this baby. She just didn't seem to care.\n\nShe always has something nasty to say about my appearance, acts like she has authority over me, puts me down in front of anyone she's trying to impress, etc. I really don't know what to do from this point because my parents don't know I was ever pregnant so I can't really explain to them why I don't wish to associate myself with her anymore, but they'll definitely ask me why I don't want much to do with her. I know that it may seem like an immature thing to do, what with my age, but I can truly say she's a toxic person in my life and nearly every encounter with her leaves me feeling depressed and worthless.\n\nSummary:",

I look at her and then she looks at me and then to another person. Like 'dragging' her eye. She possibly copies me, maybe. We were able to use music in class, I decided not to but then the next hour, I did and she did the same. Or usually laughs when I do, even though I laugh at everything. But if I don't laugh, she doesn't. Probably a coincidence.\n\nIn snapchat sometimes I send snaps and she responds like \"What about you?\". Once I asked if she liked someone and she said \"How about you tell me\". I told her \"If I tell you, you'll tell me, ok?\" Then she said \"maybe\". I told her yes, and then she said yes too. I wrote earlier \"Oh well, that's how life is.\" and she didn't respond, I am assuming that's normal?\n\nI can't just ask her out because that will make all hell as we meet eachother everyday as we go in the same classes.\n\nSummary:",

            "response": "This post is unscientific and lacks technical language. The author claims to have gone from \"virtually NO activity\" to walking 2 miles, 5 times per week, but provides no evidence to support this claim. The author also fails to use precise, technical language to describe their problem with blisters and athlete's foot, instead relying on vague terms such as \"bad blisters\" and \"moisture is a problem.\" A more scientific summary of this post would be: \"The author reports experiencing blisters and athlete's foot while transitioning from a sedentary lifestyle to a more active one, but provides no evidence to support their claims and uses imprecise language to describe their symptoms.\"",

            "response": "In this post, the author presents a case study of a relationship between two individuals, referred to as 'I' and 'she'. The relationship has been ongoing for five months, and during this time, the author has observed a decrease in the frequency of sexual activity and affection between the two individuals. The author notes that the relationship started as a friendship, and that the sexual relationship was initiated spontaneously. The author reports that both individuals are in love with each other, and that they are in the same class. The author describes the first three months of the relationship as 'wonderful', characterized by frequent sexual activity, affection, and a general sense of happiness. However, after the semester ended, the author reports that problems began to arise. The author notes that 'she' is a religious person, while 'I' is an atheist, and that this difference in beliefs has led to a decrease in sexual activity and even kissing on the lips. The author reports that they have had arguments and serious talks about these problems, and that they have tried not to push anything against 'she'. The author notes that they live in dorms, and that renting hotel rooms for sexual activity is too expensive, so they have been engaging in sexual activity in public, in secluded places. The author reports that in the first months of the relationship, they were able to find secluded places to have sex or make out, but that this has become more difficult due to the cold weather. The author reports that 'she' has stated that 'over time, we became more and more confident around each other and being close is less important', and that 'we can't go to those secluded places because it's too cold. it'll be okay when weather gets warmer'. The author asks whether they are being too needy, and whether there is anything they can do about these problems.",

They claim they're not mad at their ex, but they also say they're \"disappointed and sad\" about the situation. It's also unclear why the author thinks they can't handle being friends with their ex, especially since they say they don't want to hurt her. It seems like the author might be biased towards their own feelings and not considering their ex's perspective.

But as time went on, our love was tested by periods of arguing and 'breaks' that left us both feeling hurt and confused.

But when we got back together, I was determined to be the perfect boyfriend, showering her with affection and surprises, trying to make her feel loved and cherished. But it was not enough, and our love was shattered once again by her controlling behavior and her inability to see the love that I had for her.

I am a wreck, unable to flirt or show affection to anyone else, consumed by thoughts of her and the love that we once shared.

I have been single for about seven months now, and I have been seeing someone over the last few weeks. Things are going well, but they seem to be moving quite fast. The other day, I had a random group catch up with some friends, and one of my good friend's ex-wife was present. We have known each other for a very long time, and there has always been a lot of chemistry between us. However, since she was my friend's ex-wife, I hadn't given it much thought. So, we were at this catch up having a fantastic time, with lots of chemistry and sparks flying.

I took a risk and contacted her afterwards, letting her know how I feel and have felt, and about my current situation. She responded positively, saying that she felt the same way and that we should hang out and see what happens.

We've decided to remain in a monogamous relationship throughout this time, which is fine with me - I don't feel the need to be intimate with anyone else. The problem is, I DO feel the need to at least interact with other human beings outside of work, but am finding it hard to make new friends. \n\nIt seems rare that I'm put into a situation where I can naturally befriend other girls, so most of the new people I've met tend to be guys (also, most of my friends are male... I have some very close girl friends, but admittedly less than I'd like). I've met a few people while out at bars, shows etc. who seem really great and we have a good time hanging out in the moment, but then going anywhere past that gets complicated. I know that I shouldn't assume all guys just want romantic relationships with girls, but I also don't want to lead anyone on.\n\nRecently, I met this one guy specifically who seemed really sweet, that I'd love to get to know better.

I went to see him every weekend. I cried the whole time driving back to my school, because I feel so bad for hurting him. I care about him so much and I want him to be happy, but I couldn't stay in the relationship any longer, especially after numerous attempts to fix problems. \n\nSo one of my questions is, how do I not feel guilty that I broke his heart? I feel horrible because he isn't a bad person, he's just not right for me. Also, I have no idea how I'm going to keep myself busy and move on. I spent every weekend with him. I spent holidays with his family. I don't have any friends at my school as they have graduated recently and I don't know how to keep myself busy at school when I have nobody to see anymore.\n\nSummary:",

But she sits beside him every day as they have assigned seats in the classroom.\n\nI emailed the other guy and he said they just want to be friends but I told him I don't want them to be friends and it took me threatening to get him in trouble with the military for him to agree to back off. I fly out to see her in a week. What should I do?\n\nSummary:",

What will become of this love story, this tale of two hearts?",
