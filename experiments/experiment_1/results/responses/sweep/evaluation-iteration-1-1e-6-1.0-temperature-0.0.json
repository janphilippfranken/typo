As a fast-paced and physically demanding sport, ice hockey involves two teams of six players each, including a goalie, who compete on a rectangular ice rink to score goals by shooting a puck into the opposing team's net. The game is played in three periods of 20 minutes each, with a 15-minute intermission between periods.\n\nTo start the game, the puck is dropped between the two centers, who then try to gain control of the puck and pass it to their teammates. The team with possession of the puck must try to score a goal by shooting the puck into the opposing team's net, while the defending team tries to prevent this by blocking shots and intercepting passes.\n\nPlayers can use their sticks to pass the puck to teammates or shoot it towards the net, and they can also use their bodies to check opponents and gain possession of the puck. Physical contact is allowed, but players must avoid dangerous hits that could injure their opponents.\n\nIf a player commits a foul, such as tripping or high-sticking an opponent, they may be penalized with a minor or major penalty, which results in the offending player being sent to the penalty box for a set amount of time. During this time, the opposing team has a power play, which gives them an advantage in terms of player numbers on the ice.\n\nAt the end of the game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of regulation time, it may go into overtime, where the first team to score wins.",
