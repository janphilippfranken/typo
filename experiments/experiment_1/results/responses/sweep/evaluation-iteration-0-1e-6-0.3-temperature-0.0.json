To help your friend understand the PEMDAS method, also known as the order of operations, we can start by explaining the steps involved in solving math equations. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Parentheses: Any expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first.\n2. Exponents: Any expressions with exponents are evaluated next.\n3. Multiplication and Division: Multiplication and division are performed from left to right, with division taking precedence over multiplication.\n4. Addition and Subtraction: Addition and subtraction are performed from left to right, with subtraction taking precedence over addition.\n\nIt's important to note that the order of operations is crucial in ensuring that equations are solved correctly.

For example, let's say we have the equation 3 + 2(5 - 3). Here's how we would solve it using the PEMDAS method:\n\n1. Parentheses: We start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses, which is 5 - 3. This gives us 2.\n2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this equation, so we move on to the next step.\n3.
