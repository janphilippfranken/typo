        "387": "Oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, which are compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. To turn oil into gasoline, it undergoes a process called refining, which involves separating the different components of the oil into their individual components.\n\nThe first step in refining oil is to heat it to a high temperature, which causes the different components to separate into their individual components. The lighter components, such as gasoline, rise to the top, while the heavier components, such as diesel and kerosene, sink to the bottom.\n\nOnce the oil has been separated into its individual components, the gasoline is further refined to remove impurities and to increase its octane rating. The octane rating is a measure of the gasoline's ability to resist knocking, which is a type of engine damage caused by the premature ignition of the fuel.\n\nThe final step in refining oil into gasoline is to add additives to the gasoline to improve its performance and to protect the engine. These additives include detergents, which help to clean the engine, and anti-knock agents, which help to prevent knocking.\n\nOverall, the process of refining oil into gasoline is a complex and multi-step process that involves separating the different components of the oil into their individual components, further refining the gasoline to remove impurities and to increase its octane rating, and adding additives to the gasoline to improve its performance and to protect the engine.",
