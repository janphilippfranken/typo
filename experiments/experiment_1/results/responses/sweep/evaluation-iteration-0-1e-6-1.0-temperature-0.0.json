To help your friend understand the PEMDAS method, also known as the order of operations, we can start by explaining the acronym:\n\n- P - Parentheses\n- E - Exponents\n- M - Multiplication\n- D - Division\n- A - Addition\n- S - Subtraction\n\nThe PEMDAS method is used to determine the order in which mathematical operations should be performed in an expression. It helps to ensure that the correct answer is obtained by following a specific order of operations.\n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\n(3 + 2) \u00d7 4 - 1\n\nUsing the PEMDAS method, we would first perform the operations inside the parentheses, which is (3 + 2) = 5. Then, we would perform the exponent operation, which is 5 \u00d7 4 = 20. Next, we would perform the multiplication operation, which is 20 - 1 = 19. Finally, we would perform the subtraction operation, which is 19 - 1 = 18.\n\nHopefully this explanation helps your friend understand the PEMDAS method!

        "102": "Hello! Kickball is a fun and popular team sport that combines elements of baseball and soccer. The game is played on a diamond-shaped field with two teams of nine players each. The objective is to score runs by kicking the ball and running around the bases. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.\n\nTo start the game, the team that is kicking off chooses a player to be the kicker. The kicker stands on home plate and kicks the ball, which is then fielded by the opposing team. The kicker must then run to the first base and touch it with their foot before the ball is thrown to the first baseman. If the kicker is successful in reaching the first base, they can then run to the second base and so on.\n\nThe opposing team can try to stop the kicker by fielding the ball and throwing it to the base where the kicker is running to. If the kicker is tagged with the ball before they reach the base, they are out and must return to the dugout.\n\nThe game is played in innings, with each team getting a chance to kick off and score runs. The game is usually played to a certain number of runs or a certain number of innings.\n\nOverall, kickball is a fun and exciting game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a great way to get exercise and spend time with friends and family.",
