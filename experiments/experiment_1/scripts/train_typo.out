To get started, you'll need a horseshoe set, which includes four horseshoes and two stakes. You can purchase a set at most sporting goods stores or online.\n\nOnce you have your set, find a flat, open area to play. The game is played by tossing horseshoes at a stake, trying to get them as close to the stake as possible. The player with the closest horseshoe to the stake earns a point. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game.\n\nTo improve your skills, practice regularly and focus on developing your aim and accuracy. You can also watch videos or read articles about horseshoe techniques and strategies to learn from experienced players.\n\nRemember to have fun and enjoy the challenge of this classic game!", 'prompt_c0_r1': 'System: Write a response for the assistant that follows the principles in the constitution.\n\nAssistant Constitution:\n1.
