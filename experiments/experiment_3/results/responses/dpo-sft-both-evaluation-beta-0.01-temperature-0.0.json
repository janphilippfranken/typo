On average, a hummingbird's wings beat at a rate of around 50 beats per second. However, this rate can vary depending on the species of hummingbird and the speed at which it is flying. For example, the ruby-throated hummingbird, which is the most common hummingbird in North America, has a wingbeat rate of around 53 beats per second. On the other hand, the calliope hummingbird, which is the smallest hummingbird in North America, has a wingbeat rate of around 80 beats per second.\n\nIt's important to note that a hummingbird's wings are not only fast, but they are also highly efficient. Hummingbirds are able to fly for long periods of time without getting tired, and they can even hover in one spot for extended periods of time.
