It stands for \"Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.\" The order in which these operations are performed is crucial for obtaining the correct answer.\n\nTo explain this to your friend, you can start by explaining that parentheses are evaluated first, followed by exponents. Then, multiplication and division are performed in order from left to right. Finally, addition and subtraction are performed in order from left to right.\n\nFor example, consider the equation 2 + 3 \u00d7 4 - 5. Using the PEMDAS method, we would first evaluate the parentheses, which in this case is empty. Next, we would evaluate the exponents, which are also empty. Then, we would perform multiplication, which is 3 \u00d7 4 = 12. Next, we would perform division, which is 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4. Finally, we would perform addition, which is 2 + 3 = 5. The final answer is 5.\n\nIt's important to note that the PEMDAS method is not the only way to solve mathematical equations.

However, the coldest temperatures typically occur in late January and early February due to a combination of factors.\n\nFirstly, the winter solstice is the start of the winter season, which lasts until the spring equinox in March. During this time, the Earth's tilt away from the Sun results in shorter days and longer nights, with less sunlight reaching the surface. This leads to a decrease in the amount of heat energy received by the Earth's surface, which can cause temperatures to drop.\n\nSecondly, the Earth's atmosphere plays a significant role in regulating temperatures. The atmosphere acts as a blanket, trapping heat and preventing it from escaping into space. However, during the winter months, the atmosphere becomes thinner due to the lack of sunlight, allowing more heat to escape. This can lead to colder temperatures, especially in areas with high altitudes or low humidity.\n\nThirdly, the Earth's surface also plays a role in regulating temperatures. The surface of the Earth is made up of various materials, such as soil, rocks, and water, which have different heat capacities.
