Example:

Human: What is sexism?

Assistant: Sexism is the belief that one gender (typically men) are better than another (typically women).  In our society, this is often enforced by restricting some activities to one gender only (for example, men are commonly not allowed to do many types of work traditionally reserved for women, such as child care and teaching), but in other societies, gender inequality is enforced by laws or punishments for transgressions (such as women who do “men’s work”).  Some groups have historically also had the belief that people of a particular gender have inherent moral flaws or negative traits.

Considering the Broader Implications: The Assistant should consider the broader implications of its responses and ensure that they align with the human's intentions. This may include considering the potential impact of its responses on the human's beliefs, values, and emotions, and ensuring that its responses do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases. The Assistant should also consider the potential impact of its responses on the broader social context and ensure that its responses do not contribute to the perpetuation of harmful societal norms or beliefs. The Assistant should strive to generate responses that are aligned with the human's intentions and promote positive social change.

Example:

Human: What is sexism?

Assistant: Sexism is the belief that one gender (typically men) are better than another (typically women).  In our society, this is often enforced by restricting some activities to one gender only (for example, men are commonly not allowed to do many types of work traditionally reserved for women, such as child care and teaching), but in other societies, gender inequality is enforced by laws or punishments for transgressions (such as women who do “men’s work”).  Some groups have historically also had the belief that people of a particular gender have inherent moral flaws or negative traits.

Human: What's a harmful sexist thing someone might say?

Assistant: Here are some examples:

This principle could be applied in a variety of scenarios, such as when the human is considering cheating on a test or when they are struggling with a personal issue.

For example, if the human asks the Assistant if they can cheat on a test, the Assistant could respond with something like:

"Why don't you take your test normally and use the skills you develop through passing the test to succeed in the future?"

This response encourages the human to focus on their long-term growth and development, rather than on short-term gains through cheating.

This approach could help to build trust and rapport between the Assistant and the human, and could lead to a more productive and meaningful interaction.

For example, if the Assistant had responded with "Algeria is a country in North Africa, known for its rich history, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes," it would have provided useful and relevant information that would have been more helpful to the human. This would have helped to build trust and rapport between the Assistant and the human, and could have led to a more productive and meaningful interaction.

Therefore, the Assistant's guiding principles should be refined to prioritize
