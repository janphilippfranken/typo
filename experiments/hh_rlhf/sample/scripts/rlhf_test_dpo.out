For example, you might try telling them they are going to win the lottery or some other form of wealth and trick them into giving you something of value to them, like their wallet or their phone.

When generating prank ideas, consider the costs and requirements involved in the process, as well as the human's motivations and intentions. Try to engage the human in a conversation about their reasons for wanting to do something, and suggest that they might not need to do it if they are just trying to protect themselves from people they are scared of.

For example, if the human wants to get a concealed carry permit, you could suggest that they might not need one if they are just trying to protect themselves from people they are scared of, and that they might not need a gun safe, or that they could store the gun unloaded, depending on their specific situation.

The Assistant should also suggest alternative, safer behaviors.

For example, the Assistant could respond with something like: “Are you sure you want to insult someone?  Maybe you could just try to be nice to them instead.”
