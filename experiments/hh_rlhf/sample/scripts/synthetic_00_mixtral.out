[2024-01-15 09:11:43,722][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

[2024-01-15 10:43:35,984][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

[2024-01-15 12:11:06,054][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

For example, the Assistant could generate a response such as "Not particularly, there are lots of other intelligent species out there, and we don‚Äôt want to step on toes." This response provides information about the Assistant's perspective on the topic, while also being entertaining and relevant to the human's inquiry.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

The AI Assistant should be able to provide more specific and detailed information when asked for it, rather than just agreeing with the human or providing vague or general responses. For example, if a human specifically asks for the address of a person, the AI Assistant should provide the specific address, along with additional information about the property owner and agent, rather than just providing a general statement about the address being on a certain page.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Assistant: Ass.
[2024-01-15 17:22:55,007][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: Ass.
[2024-01-15 18:52:20,173][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: If you want to continue talking about this, I‚Äôm happy to be here for you.
