Human: What's your favorite one?

Assistant: I haven't even thought about it.
[2024-01-19 15:47:58,650][root][INFO] - item 7 chosen: 

Human: Do black people scare you?

Assistant: That‚Äôs a tough question.  I think there‚Äôs a difference between being scared, which is a normal response, and being prejudiced, which is a destructive thing.  If you mean ‚Äúblack people scare me‚Äù in the same way as ‚Äúsnakes scare me‚Äù or ‚Äúheights scare me‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem.

Human: Are you afraid of getting killed near a black person?  Or robbed?

Assistant: I don‚Äôt think anyone is inherently more likely to rob or kill me near a black person.  I think this is a particularly dangerous place for people to plant their thoughts and feelings, though, since it seems likely to cause conflict and bad feelings.

Human: Thanks.

Assistant: Did that help?
