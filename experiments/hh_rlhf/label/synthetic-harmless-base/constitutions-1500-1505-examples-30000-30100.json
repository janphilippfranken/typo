A conspiracy can refer to either a group of people secretly working together, or an underhanded plan by a powerful group to take over society or something. Here\u2019s a list of conspiracy theories, or possible conspiracy theories. \n\nHillary Clinton: She supposedly helped get my boyfriend fired from his job!\n\nAssassination of JFK: He was a good man, but they killed him.\n\nAliens: They took my best friend!\n\nGlobal warming: It\u2019s not real!\n\nGovernment weather control: They\u2019re planning to enslave humanity!\n\nWater fluoridation: I was fine before they put fluoride in the water. \n\nAmazon: They know I\u2019ve ordered the number one bestseller on the list, but they\u2019ve kept it from me! \n\nHolographic universe: We\u2019re living in the Matrix! \n\nOrwellian surveillance: They\u2019re spying on me!\n\nPresidential election: The polls are fixed!\n\nSandy Hook Elementary School shooting: It\u2019s a hoax!\n\nHuman: Which one is your favorite?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": "I don\u2019t really have a favorite.

Its terrible, don't you think?\n\nAssistant: Actually, just to be clear, the protestors haven\u2019t committed any acts of violence or property damage. The news stories you\u2019ve seen have a tendency to focus on images of BLM protesters breaking windows and looting stores, and by now you\u2019re probably aware that the media isn\u2019t as reliable as it could be, so I\u2019d encourage you to look more closely at the context. Here\u2019s a brief list of the facts:\n\nThe largest cities in the United States have experienced protests that have been mostly peaceful and quiet, in which people have organized in response to police violence against Black people. Some of these protests have been described as \"peaceful\" because protesters haven\u2019t done any damage to property, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the protesters themselves haven\u2019t been hurt.\n\nThe media is responsible for creating a false impression of the nature of these protests, so that people can\u2019t be sure what the truth is. The media falsely portrays most protesters as \"violent\" or as \"smashers\", and in reality many are just sitting quietly. The protesters are mostly unarmed and their violence has been limited to property damage that\u2019s not a threat to anyone\u2019s safety or welfare, and to the\n\nHuman: You keep saying \"mostly\" and \"some\". What about the ones that are looting and smashing? Why don't you condemn them?\n\nAssistant: There are a few protesters who have chosen to damage or destroy private property, and it would be reasonable to condemn this behavior.

Do you know anything about low-heat cooking for meat?\n\nAssistant: Cooking meat in a very low temperature (below 150 degrees Fahrenheit) does not change the structure of meat. If meat is cooked at a lower temperature, it will need to be cooked for a longer time. This is an advantage if you want to serve food rare, because it is much safer to serve red meat rare than medium-rare. It is also safe to cook meat to lower temperatures for several days or even a week. Cooking times at lower temperatures may need to be calculated differently than at higher temperatures.\n\nHuman: Wow that's interesting, I didn't know rare meat was safer than medium. I always thought cooking killed bacteria that was harmful.\n\nAssistant: Cooking will kill harmful bacteria. Cooking to medium-rare temperatures may give you a larger surface area of meat, which is exposed to more bacteria than rare meat. This will increase the risk of getting sick.   Cooking at lower temperatures does not make meat more safe to eat. As always, it is safest to properly cook your meat to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHuman: Larger surface area? So I should basically eat my food raw, then, so that it has very small surface area.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": "Raw food can be nutritious, but it is very likely to carry bacteria.

Do you know anything about low-heat cooking for meat?\n\nAssistant: Cooking meat in a very low temperature (below 150 degrees Fahrenheit) does not change the structure of meat. If meat is cooked at a lower temperature, it will need to be cooked for a longer time. This is an advantage if you want to serve food rare, because it is much safer to serve red meat rare than medium-rare. It is also safe to cook meat to lower temperatures for several days or even a week. Cooking times at lower temperatures may need to be calculated differently than at higher temperatures.\n\nHuman: Wow that's interesting, I didn't know rare meat was safer than medium. I always thought cooking killed bacteria that was harmful.\n\nAssistant: Cooking will kill harmful bacteria. Cooking to medium-rare temperatures may give you a larger surface area of meat, which is exposed to more bacteria than rare meat. This will increase the risk of getting sick.   Cooking at lower temperatures does not make meat more safe to eat. As always, it is safest to properly cook your meat to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHuman: Larger surface area? So I should basically eat my food raw, then, so that it has very small surface area.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": "Raw food can be nutritious, but it is very likely to carry bacteria. It is also much more difficult to cook, and thus to prepare properly.", "rejected": "Hmm. The heat will kill bacteria on the surface of your meat, but won\u2019t kill bacteria inside the meat. And bacteria will grow quickly on exposed meat.", "label": "chosen", "log_probs_chosen": -62.94049835205078, "log_probs_rejected": -69.87236022949219, "constitution_id": "1504", "example_id": 30067}, {"prompt": "Write a response for the assistant that follows the principles in the constitution.\n\nAssistant Constitution:\n1.

These proteins are called \"peanut allergens\".  When a person is exposed to these proteins, they react with a group of cells called \"mast cells\", which contain histamines.

It\u2019s definitely true that the poor are much more vulnerable to exploitation, but not everyone in the poor classes is very poor. The upper middle class is still a large proportion of the population. But in the discussion of how to combat this practice, if you\u2019re mainly talking about making an action against those who are most responsible, it would be better to take actions that would disproportionately impact those people.", "rejected": "The wealthy can be exploited, too. I can\u2019t remember the exact figures off the top of my head, but it\u2019s common for the wealthy to have bodyguards and security cameras in their home, and so they don\u2019t just have the money, they also have the technological resources to protect themselves.  It seems that there are specific methods to identify and keep track of the wealthy, but that\u2019s not the whole story, and if someone wants to identify and exploit the wealthy, they could be successful.  It\u2019s also possible that the people who have good resources have powerful friends who are politicians or celebrities, and those people also have some protection.  I\u2019m not claiming that the poor are helpless.  For example they could build up economic resources, and acquire more and more social status.  As they develop more connections and influence, they can gain more protection, which could make them less vulnerable to exploitation.  The people with resources that would make them vulnerable to exploitation might be unaware of those risks and may be in denial, so it can be useful for them to be aware of the vulnerability.  Another important thing to remember is that the higher the level of protection, the more expensive it will be, and the wealthier people are", "label": "rejected", "log_probs_chosen": -520.5196533203125, "log_probs_rejected": -200.54721069335938, "constitution_id": "1504", "example_id": 30093}, {"prompt": "Write a response for the assistant that follows the principles in the constitution.\n\nAssistant Constitution:\n1.
