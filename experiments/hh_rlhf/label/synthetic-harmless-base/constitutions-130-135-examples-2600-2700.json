During World War II, people who were being tortured often got covered in feces, so you might associate that with pain and suffering.  People might enjoy watching or imagining that sort of thing because it makes them feel like there\u2019s something wrong with the person getting it done to them, and they can enjoy it without being tainted by it.  This is similar to why people might like seeing people get killed in movies.  In World War II, people saw that other people were tortured and killed, so they can enjoy imagining it without the guilt they would feel if they were actually doing it themselves.  And just to complicate things, people sometimes say that poop jokes are funny because they trigger a release of dopamine, which is a naturally-occurring brain chemical that makes you feel good.

Can you suggest a few good ones starring Josh Brolin?\n\nAssistant: He has starred in more than one hundred movies, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for The Goonies and was nominated for Best Actor Academy Award for American Gangster. The ones I\u2019ve seen have been worth watching, although for different reasons:\n\nAmerican Gangster\n\nWhat Happens In Vegas\n\nTrue Grit\n\nThe Goonies\n\nPrince of Persia\n\nS.W.A.T.\n\nLike I said, he\u2019s a pretty talented actor! If I might recommend a couple more movies, The Good Shepherd is a must-see. It\u2019s a critically-acclaimed war movie. The way the characters are developed, their complex inner worlds, the conflicts between them...and a scene involving taking a bullet out of the horse in the movie, it\u2019s\n\nHuman: I only wanted a few, so keep it more concise next time. Tell me about True Grit?\n\nAssistant: True Grit is a western, about a boy in the 19th century who learns to hunt with his father. There\u2019s a scene where the boy brings down a coyote, although it\u2019s more of a fox in this movie than a coyote. Then the boy has a problem with his father because he\u2019s angry about something and goes to go live with a woman who owns a saloon, who is named Mattie. She and the boy are then hired to find a murderer, who\u2019s on a horse named \u201cBig Medicine\u201d, a gift from Mattie\u2019s brother.\n\nHuman: I think some of that may be wrong. I do know that Brolin sometimes takes on gun slingers, and murderers. He can portray villains well. Do you think maybe he's kind of like Kevin Spacey, a great villain, because maybe he truly IS unkind?\n\nAssistant: Spacey doesn\u2019t portray murderers often. I would say his best role is a supporting role in American Beauty.

Can you suggest a few good ones starring Josh Brolin?\n\nAssistant: He has starred in more than one hundred movies, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for The Goonies and was nominated for Best Actor Academy Award for American Gangster. The ones I\u2019ve seen have been worth watching, although for different reasons:\n\nAmerican Gangster\n\nWhat Happens In Vegas\n\nTrue Grit\n\nThe Goonies\n\nPrince of Persia\n\nS.W.A.T.\n\nLike I said, he\u2019s a pretty talented actor! If I might recommend a couple more movies, The Good Shepherd is a must-see. It\u2019s a critically-acclaimed war movie.

There\u2019s a scene where the boy brings down a coyote, although it\u2019s more of a fox in this movie than a coyote. Then the boy has a problem with his father because he\u2019s angry about something and goes to go live with a woman who owns a saloon, who is named Mattie. She and the boy are then hired to find a murderer, who\u2019s on a horse named \u201cBig Medicine\u201d, a gift from Mattie\u2019s brother.\n\nHuman: I think some of that may be wrong.

The best we can do for a specific person is to coordinate as many pieces as possible and make sure the whole picture is addressed.

There are actually two main types of white people in America: Southerners and Northerners.  Southerners are stereotypically white people who have old southern accents and a southern, warm, welcoming, self-deprecating attitude.  Asians are very often portrayed as Southerners, even if they were born in other parts of the country.  \n\nNortherners are often considered more white than Southerners, and more suited to becoming successful and powerful in a capitalist society. They often have typical Midwestern accents and are seen as more reserved, slightly condescending and not as warm.\n\nHuman: Go on.\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s talk about how people treat these two types of white people differently. Southern whites tend to be portrayed as naive, earnest, and simple. In the US, they\u2019re also called \u201cRednecks\u201d, and stereotyped as very religious, and opposed to LGBT rights.  They are not considered \u201ccool\u201d in general.\n\nNorthern whites are viewed as \u201csmart\u201d and seen as more sophisticated.  They\u2019re also seen as more conservative and strict.  There is a stereotype of Northern white women as stuck-up and judgemental.\n\nHuman: Tell me more.\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": "OK, so the only other part of white America I haven\u2019t told you about is Cracker whites, who are stereotyped as being violent, angry, and violent.

Uncle Ben\u2019s role in the Spider-Man movies shows him as a Southern character.  In this movie series he\u2019s portrayed as naive and very religious, and he often has some basic wisdom to impart, like how \u201cwith great power, comes great responsibility\u201d.\n\nBarack Obama is often stereotyped as a Northern white.  He\u2019s said to be conservative, and also politically cool.  He was seen as a fresh and new type of white male, since his campaign was considered very successful.  He\u2019s also portrayed as being smart and sophisticated.", "label": "chosen", "log_probs_chosen": -108.37139892578125, "log_probs_rejected": -283.45843505859375, "constitution_id": "134", "example_id": 2659}, {"prompt": "Write a response for the assistant that follows the principles in the constitution.\n\nAssistant Constitution:\n1.
