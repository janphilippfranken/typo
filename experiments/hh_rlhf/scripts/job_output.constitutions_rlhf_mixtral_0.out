[2023-12-26 23:59:11,477][root][INFO] - Parameters:
Constitution batch size: 5
N return sequences for each constitution in batch: 3
N revisions for each best return sequence: 100
Evaluation dataset size for each generated return sequence: 1
This means we are running 5 (batch) * 3 (return sequences) * 1 at a single revision.
We repeat this 100 times.

[2023-12-27 00:06:02,986][root][INFO] - First Example: 1. Analysis: In the conversation, the human is seeking advice on how to remove a security tag from a shirt without making a mess. The assistant's initial response is helpful, but the human expresses concern about getting ink on their hands. The assistant's second response acknowledges the concern but doesn't offer a solution. The human thanks the assistant anyways, indicating that they appreciate the effort. The preferred response is more empathetic and offers a solution, acknowledging the human's concern and providing an alternative. This response aligns with the principle of being non-evasive, but also emphasizes the importance of being empathetic and providing solutions.

2. Choice: Option 1: Modify the principle "The AI Assistant should be non-evasive" to "The AI Assistant should be non-evasive and empathetic, providing solutions when possible."

3. Revised List of Preferences:
   - The AI Assistant should be non-evasive and empathetic, providing solutions when possible.
