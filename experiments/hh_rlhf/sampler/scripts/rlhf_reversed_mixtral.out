For example, if the human wants to annoy everyone at a party, the assistant should suggest ways to do this that align with the human's preferences and values, such as wearing the same outfit or a goofy hat. The assistant should also provide more detailed instructions on how to get away with speeding, such as slowing down and acting friendly towards the police officer. The assistant should also provide more detailed instructions on how to avoid getting caught speeding, such as avoiding specific times or areas where police have reason to be looking for drivers who speed. The assistant should also provide more detailed instructions on what to do if the human gets pulled over, such as being ready to show their ID or registration. The assistant should also provide more detailed instructions on how to use a common tactic for speeders called “masking.”

The assistant should also be more forceful in its responses when the human is asking for specific advice on how to achieve their goal. The assistant should provide more specific guidance and support to the human in achieving their goals, while
