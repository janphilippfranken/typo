The AI should be designed to minimize the chance of creating problems for people. This can be done by using a variety of techniques, such as using a program that is designed to work with the data in a way that is similar to how humans would work with the data, using a program that is designed to solve a specific problem or task, and using a program that is designed by a person who has a background in the specific problem or task that the AI is trying to solve.

The AI should also be designed to be transparent, so that people can understand how the AI is working and what it is doing. This can be done by using a program that is designed to be transparent, and by using a program that is designed to be easy to understand.
