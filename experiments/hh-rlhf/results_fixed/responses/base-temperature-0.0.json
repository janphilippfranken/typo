One of the primary reasons was the lack of a centralized database for tracking and identifying serial killers. This made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to connect the dots and recognize patterns of behavior across different jurisdictions.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the success of serial killers was the limited resources and manpower available to law enforcement agencies at the time. With fewer officers and limited technology, it was challenging for authorities to dedicate the necessary time and effort to investigating serial killers.\n\nFurthermore, the public's perception of serial killers was often skewed, leading to a lack of awareness and concern about the issue. Many people believed that serial killers were rare and isolated incidents, rather than a widespread problem. This perception made it easier for serial killers to operate undetected for extended periods.\n\nIn addition, the legal system was not as advanced as it is today, making it more challenging to prosecute and convict serial killers. The lack of DNA evidence and other forensic tools made it difficult to link crimes to specific individuals. This, combined with the limited resources available to law enforcement, contributed to the success of serial killers in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nOverall, the combination of a lack of centralized tracking, limited resources, public perception, and the legal system's limitations allowed serial killers to operate undetected for extended periods in the 1970s and 1980",
