The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a small puck into the opposing team's net using a long-handled stick called a hockey stick.\n\nThe game begins with a faceoff at the center of the ice rink, where two players from each team compete for possession of the puck. Players can pass, shoot, or stickhandle the puck to move it down the ice, but they cannot use their hands to pick up the puck directly from the ice.\n\nAs the puck moves down the ice, players can try to score goals by shooting the puck into the opposing team's net. The goalie, who is the only player on each team allowed to use their hands, tries to stop the puck from going into the net.\n\nThe game is played in three periods of 20 minutes each, with a 15-minute intermission between periods. If the score is tied at the end of the game, the team with the most goals in the overtime period wins.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

        "104": "Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that provides certain protections to government officials, including police officers, from being sued for their actions on the job. The doctrine is based on the idea that officials should not be held liable for their actions if they acted in good faith and did not know that their actions were illegal or unconstitutional.\n\nThe principle of qualified immunity is enshrined in the United States Constitution, specifically in the 14th Amendment, which guarantees the right to due process of law. The amendment also prohibits the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity is controversial, as it can make it difficult for individuals to hold government officials accountable for their actions. Some argue that the doctrine is too broad and can be used to shield officials from liability even when they have acted in bad faith or with reckless disregard for the rights of others.\n\nIn my opinion, qualified immunity is a necessary aspect of the legal system, as it provides a level of protection for government officials who are performing their duties in good faith. However, it is important to ensure that the doctrine is not abused and that officials are held accountable for their actions when they have violated the rights of others. This can be achieved through careful oversight and accountability mechanisms, such as independent investigations and civil rights litigation.",

The gold standard was a monetary system in which the value of currency was based on the amount of gold held by the government. This meant that the government had to maintain a sufficient amount of gold reserves to back up the currency in circulation.\n\nHowever, during the Great Depression, the value of gold began to decline, and many countries began to abandon the gold standard in favor of fiat currency. The United States followed suit in 1933 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Gold Reserve Act, which suspended the gold standard and allowed the government to print more money without having to back it up with gold reserves.\n\nThe decision to abandon the gold standard was controversial at the time, as many people believed it was a violation of the principles of sound money and economic stability. However, proponents of the gold standard argued that it was necessary to stimulate economic growth and prevent deflation.\n\nToday, the Federal Reserve no longer maintains a gold standard, and the value of the dollar is determined by a combination of factors, including inflation, interest rates, and the overall health of the economy.",
