This includes areas such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, which could potentially become states in the future. Additionally, there are many territories and protectorates that are not currently part of any state, such as American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, which could also become states in the future.\n\nSecond, the US has a history of adding new states to the union to address political and economic concerns. For example, the addition of new states has helped to balance the power between different regions of the country and has also helped to address economic concerns by providing new markets and resources.\n\nThird, the US has a long history of immigration, and many people from other countries have come to the US to live and work. These immigrants often have a strong desire to become citizens and to participate in the political process, and adding new states to the union could help to address this desire.\n\nOverall, I believe that the US will continue to add new states to the union in the future, as this has been a long-standing tradition in the country and there are many reasons why it may continue in the future.",
