During this period, there were several factors that contributed to the ability of serial killers to evade detection and continue their crimes.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the success of serial killers during this time was the lack of a centralized database for criminal records. This made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to share information and track the movements of known offenders. Additionally, the lack of DNA testing and other advanced forensic techniques made it challenging to link crimes to specific individuals.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to the success of serial killers was the lack of public awareness and concern about serial killers. At the time, the term \"serial killer\" was not widely used, and the general public was not as aware of the existence of these types of criminals. This lack of awareness made it easier for serial killers to operate without being detected.\n\nFurthermore, the criminal justice system during this time was often overburdened and underfunded, which made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to devote the necessary resources to investigating and prosecuting serial killers. This was particularly true in rural areas, where resources were even more limited.\n\nFinally, the social and cultural norms of the time also played a role in the success of serial killers. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a greater acceptance of violence and a lack of empathy for victims, which made it easier for serial killers to operate without being held accountable for",
