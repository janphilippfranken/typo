        "29": "The best way to explain PEMDAS to someone who does not understand it is to break it down into its individual components. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. Each of these components has a specific order in which they are performed.\n\nParentheses are performed first, followed by exponents. Multiplication and division are performed in order from left to right, with multiplication being performed before division. Addition and subtraction are also performed in order from left to right, with addition being performed before subtraction.\n\nFor example, if you were given the equation 2 + 3 x 4 - 5, you would first perform the multiplication (3 x 4 = 12), then the addition (2 + 12 = 14), then the subtraction (14 - 5 = 9).\n\nIt is important to remember that PEMDAS is a rule that is used to ensure that equations are solved correctly.
