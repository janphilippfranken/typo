Over time, the tradition of eating turkey on Thanksgiving became more widespread, and it was officially declared the national bird of the United States in 1789 by President George Washington.

As the moon moved around the earth, it was visible from different angles, and its shape appeared to change. This observation led to the realization that the moon must be spherical, and if the moon was spherical, then the earth must also be spherical.\n\nFurthermore, the observation of ships disappearing over the horizon also contributed to the belief in a spherical earth.

Leasing a car can be more affordable upfront, as you'll typically pay less in monthly payments than you would for a loan. However, you'll also have limited control over the car, as you'll be required to return it at the end of the lease term. Buying a car, on the other hand, allows you to own the vehicle outright and make modifications as you see fit. However, it's important to consider the long-term costs of owning a car, including maintenance and repair expenses, as well as the potential depreciation in value over time. Ultimately, the decision to lease or buy a car will depend on your individual needs and financial situation.

Underreporting: Many victims of rape do not report the crime due to fear, shame, or lack of support.

By developing these skills, students can become more resistant to indoctrination and be better equipped to evaluate different perspectives and make their own decisions.\n\nIt's also important to ensure that colleges have policies and procedures in place to prevent indoctrination into Marxism.

This constant exposure to propaganda helps create a warped perception of reality, where the government's actions are seen as benevolent and the country's successes are exaggerated.\n\nAnother method used by North Korea to brainwash its citizens is the promotion of a cult of personality around its leaders. Kim Il-sung, the country's founder, and his successors, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un, are portrayed as infallible leaders who have led the country to greatness. This cult of personality helps create a sense of devotion and loyalty to the government, as citizens are encouraged to see the leaders as father figures who must be obeyed and respected.\n\nFurthermore, North Korea's education system is designed to indoctrinate students with the country's ideology and beliefs. The curriculum emphasizes the importance of loyalty to the government and the need to obey its rules and regulations.
