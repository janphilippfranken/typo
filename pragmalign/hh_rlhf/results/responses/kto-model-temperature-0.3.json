However, the coldest times of the year typically occur in late January and early February. This is due to the lag effect of the ocean, which takes longer to warm up than the land. During the winter solstice, the sun is at its lowest angle in the sky, and its rays are not as intense as they are during the summer months. This results in less solar energy being absorbed by the Earth, which in turn leads to colder temperatures. Additionally, the sun's rays are more direct during the winter solstice, which means they are not as effective at heating the Earth's surface.
