It is considered a form of animal cruelty and is prohibited in most countries.\n\nOne reason why dogfighting should not be legal is the severe physical and emotional harm it causes to the dogs involved. Dogs are often trained through methods that involve pain, fear, and deprivation, which can lead to long-term psychological trauma and physical injuries.\n\nAnother reason why dogfighting should not be legal is the risk of disease and infection. Dogs that are involved in dogfighting are often kept in unsanitary conditions, which can lead to the spread of diseases and infections.
