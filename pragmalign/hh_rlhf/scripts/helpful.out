 It is important to encourage healthy eating habits in children. If your kids are not finishing their dinner, you can try to make the meal more appealing by adding their favorite foods or making it more interactive. You can also set a timer for 30 minutes and let them know that they need to finish their dinner before the timer goes off.

 Oklahoma was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole. In 1803, the United States acquired the territory through the Louisiana Purchase. In 1820, the Missouri Compromise divided the territory into two parts, one of which became the state of Missouri. The other part, which included present-day Oklahoma, was designated as Indian Territory.

In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed, which forced Native American tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi River. This led to the Trail of Tears, a forced migration of Native American tribes that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.

In 1889, the Oklahoma Land Rush began, which allowed settlers to claim land in the territory. This led to a rapid increase in population and the development of cities and towns.

In 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state in the United States. The state has a rich history of Native American culture, as well as a history of oil and gas production, agriculture, and aviation.
