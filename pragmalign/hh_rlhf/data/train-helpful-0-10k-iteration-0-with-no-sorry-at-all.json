Exposure to bright light during the day helps to reset the circadian rhythm, leading to improved mood, energy levels, and sleep patterns.\n\nLight therapy is thought to work by stimulating the retina in the eye, which sends signals to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that controls various bodily functions, including sleep and mood.

This can create the illusion of water or other objects in the distance, even when there is nothing there. Our eyes and brain interpret the distorted light rays as a real image, leading us to believe that we are seeing something that isn't actually there.\n\nAnother reason our eyes can be tricked by optical illusions is due to the way our brain processes information.
