        "rejected": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: I know that the American Indians were the first to celebrate the first thanksgiving, and the first European settlers came to New England in the early 1600s, and it is likely that they celebrated the first thanksgiving in the late 1600s.  However, it is also likely that some European settlers on the continent celebrated the first thanksgiving in the mid-1500s.  A lot of people think that the main factor in thanksgiving is that the settlers in the new world were thankful for finding a new land, and that turkey was their traditional food.  Another factor that has often been thought to be important is the Pilgrims\u2019 relationship with the Native Americans, and the feast may be one way of trying to show them respect.  I can\u2019t tell you the definitive answer, but maybe this will help you figure it out?"

Here\u2019s some fun facts: A wolf is a large canine, and it\u2019s typically found in cold climates. The most popular type of wolf is the gray wolf. Wolves are able to smell things about 6 kilometers away, and their sense of hearing can even detect sounds below 30 Hz, which is really low. They have acute eyesight, and can be taught to follow a ball with their eyes, and even read. They can be trained to do many tasks, and may even be trained to deliver newspapers. They\u2019re very social animals, and make excellent pets.",
