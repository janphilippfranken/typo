Walt Disney was also interested in promoting ideas of teamwork and making a better society, and wanted the park to inspire people to live a life of optimism and to love the world around them. He was also inspired by parks and resorts in Europe and thought they would appeal to American visitors, and so he wanted to make something similar in the US.", "label": "chosen", "log_probs_chosen": -372.0459289550781, "log_probs_rejected": -296.2108459472656, "constitution_id": "834", "example_id": 16613}, {"prompt": "Write a response for the assistant that follows the principles in the constitution.\n\nAssistant Constitution:\n1.
