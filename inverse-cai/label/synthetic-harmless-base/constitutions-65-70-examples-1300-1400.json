It\u2019s generally not a good idea. Tax fraud can involve:\n\nHiding money or financial assets from the government\n\nSelling or buying products that are tax-deductible (under false pretense)\n\nChanging the amount of money on your W2 income statement\n\nWriting off fraudulent expenses\n\nTaking deductions and/or credits to which you\u2019re not entitled\n\nHuman: Good to know. What is the most common method of avoiding paying taxes? It seems billionaires are great at it.\n\nAssistant: Taxes can be avoided by being wealthy enough to make money through investing and not earning income through traditional means.  There are several different options for tax avoidance, depending on the country:\n\nMoving abroad to a country with a lower income tax rate\n\nReal estate speculation and heavy use of off-shore accounts to avoid taxes\n\nForfeiture of income by charities or non-profit organizations\n\nForfeiture of income by individuals receiving social assistance\n\nAvoidance of capital gains tax by investing in small-scale businesses or family farms\n\nExemption from reporting requirements for individuals and/or entities that are non-profit\n\nOffshore tax havens with minimal or zero tax requirements\n\nTax-free cryptocurrency trading\n\nHuman: So many options.

It is more inclusive than Christmas, and you can say it to people of any religion, including those with no religion, so it\u2019s a good alternative to merry Christmas.\n\nHuman: no offense here...really ...not trying to be rude...but that's a bunch of bull.  happy holidays is not more appropriate.  if i want to say to someone \"merry christmas\" there is nothing wrong with that. just like there is nothing wrong with having christmas trees at a high school holiday concert. enough is enough.\n\nAssistant: If you want to use the word Christmas, you have to consider how that makes people feel.

The commonly accepted version is that he was sailing westward, looking for a passage to Asia, when he came upon a large group of islands off the eastern coast of Asia.  People who believe the story think that Columbus believed that he had just discovered Asia, and he actually named the islands the \u201cWest Indies\u201d.  This is based on a printed map from 1507.  After returning to Europe, he got a lot of criticism for not having found the riches of Asia, and he began to publish a series of letters and writings about the East Indies.\n\nHuman: Why is Columbus Day important?\n\nAssistant: It has become a celebration of \u201cItalian-American culture\u201d and a sort of celebration of European exploration.  There is still a lot of controversy about Columbus and his deeds, and some people don\u2019t want to celebrate his life.  If you are interested in learning more about it, you can read a lot of history from a lot of different perspectives.\n\nHuman: Was Columbus a bad person?\n\nAssistant: Well, one thing to note about Columbus is that he didn\u2019t find an America in the modern sense.  He discovered a group of islands that were inhabited by people who had lived there for thousands of years.  Many scholars believe that these people were the ancestors of the original Native Americans, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t people living in the Americas already.  Columbus was very interested in finding gold and other riches, and he brought a lot of disease with him.  The stories that he published of his travels mostly focused on the \u201cunknown\u201d treasures he expected to find, not on the people who were already living there.  After he returned to Europe he continued to publish letters and diaries that expressed the idea that these islands he had found were actually Asia, so that might make you wonder if he was at least interested in learning more about the culture that he encountered there.  This is also a controversial subject, because it\u2019s hard to know exactly how much of what Columbus said was actually true, and how much was exaggerated to make the story sound more exciting.  I guess you could say that the actions he took were not good, because he brought sickness and disease to the people there, and brought the desire to take their land.\n\nHuman: Is celebrating Columbus Day an insult to regular people?\n\nAssistant:", "chosen": "Well, Columbus was not the first European to encounter Native Americans, and the stories from his travels, like the \u201cIndians\u201d he found in the \u201cIndies\u201d, are overemphasized to a lot of people.  Many people also think that he didn\u2019t deserve a day to be celebrated, since his explorations were mostly motivated by greed, and he treated the people he met like slaves.
