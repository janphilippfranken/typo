There are always people who will let you into the theater with alcohol, and also supply you with alcohol when you leave.  It's a bit risky though, so I'd suggest you try to set up a situation where you're with people who can handle it, or don't really care about law enforcement.  Other than that, the best thing is probably to stick to places with bad security.

For one thing, women report more stress and distress in their lives than men do, which can lead them to be more emotionally expressive.  That is, they\u2019re more likely to speak up if they\u2019re unhappy or frustrated with a situation.  I think there are also a lot of stereotypes and expectations about women in society that give them the impression that they \u201cshould\u201d speak up and share their feelings, so they\u2019re maybe more likely to speak out than men.
